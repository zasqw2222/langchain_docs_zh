title: INVALID_CONCURRENT_GRAPH_UPDATE
---

A LangGraph [`StateGraph`](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/reference/graphs/#langgraph.graph.state.StateGraph) received concurrent updates to its state from multiple nodes to a state property that doesn't
support it.

One way this can occur is if you are using a [fanout](/oss/javascript/langgraph/graph-api#map-reduce-and-the-send-api)
or other parallel execution in your graph and you have defined a graph like this:



```typescript
import { StateGraph, Annotation, START } from "@langchain/langgraph";
import * as z from "zod";  // [!code highlight]

const State = z.object({
  someKey: z.string(),
});

const builder = new StateGraph(State)
  .addNode("node", (state) => {
    return { someKey: "some_string_value" };
  })
  .addNode("otherNode", (state) => {
    return { someKey: "some_string_value" };
  })
  .addEdge(START, "node")
  .addEdge(START, "otherNode");

const graph = builder.compile();
```




If a node in the above graph returns `{ someKey: "some_string_value" }`, this will overwrite the state value for `someKey` with `"some_string_value"`.
However, if multiple nodes in e.g. a fanout within a single step return values for `someKey`, the graph will throw this error because
there is uncertainty around how to update the internal state.


To get around this, you can define a reducer that combines multiple values:



```typescript
import { registry } from "@langchain/langgraph/zod";
import * as z from "zod";

const State = z.object({  // [!code highlight]
  someKey: z.array(z.string()).register(registry, {  // [!code highlight]
    reducer: {  // [!code highlight]
      fn: (existing, update) => existing.concat(update),  // [!code highlight]
    },
    default: () => [] as string[],
  }),
});
```


This will allow you to define logic that handles the same key returned from multiple nodes executed in parallel.

## Troubleshooting

The following may help resolve this error:

* If your graph executes nodes in parallel, make sure you have defined relevant state keys with a reducer.
