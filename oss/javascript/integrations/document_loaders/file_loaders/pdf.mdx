This notebook provides a quick overview for getting started with `PDFLoader` [document loaders](/oss/javascript/integrations/document_loaders). For detailed documentation of all `PDFLoader` features and configurations head to the [API reference](https://api.js.langchain.com/classes/langchain_community_document_loaders_fs_pdf.PDFLoader.html).

## Overview

### Integration details

| Class | Package | Compatibility | Local | PY support |
| :--- | :--- | :---: | :---: |  :---: |
| [PDFLoader](https://api.js.langchain.com/classes/langchain_community_document_loaders_fs_pdf.PDFLoader.html) | [@langchain/community](https://api.js.langchain.com/modules/langchain_community_document_loaders_fs_pdf.html) | Node-only | ✅ | 🟠 (See note below) |

## Setup

To access `PDFLoader` document loader you'll need to install the `@langchain/community` integration, along with the `pdf-parse` package.

### Credentials

### Installation

The LangChain PDFLoader integration lives in the `@langchain/community` package:

<CodeGroup>
```bash npm
npm install @langchain/community @langchain/core pdf-parse
```
```bash yarn
yarn add @langchain/community @langchain/core pdf-parse
```
```bash pnpm
pnpm add @langchain/community @langchain/core pdf-parse
```
</CodeGroup>

## Instantiation

Now we can instantiate our model object and load documents:

```typescript
import { PDFLoader } from "@langchain/community/document_loaders/fs/pdf"

const nike10kPdfPath = "../../../../data/nke-10k-2023.pdf"

const loader = new PDFLoader(nike10kPdfPath)
```

## Load

```typescript
const docs = await loader.load()
docs[0]
```

```output

## Usage, one document per file

```typescript
import { PDFLoader } from "@langchain/community/document_loaders/fs/pdf";

const singleDocPerFileLoader = new PDFLoader(nike10kPdfPath, {
  splitPages: false,
});

const singleDoc = await singleDocPerFileLoader.load();
console.log(singleDoc[0].pageContent.slice(0, 100))
```

```output
Table of Contents
UNITED STATES
SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION
Washington, D.C. 20549
FORM 10-K
```

## Usage, custom `pdfjs` build

By default we use the `pdfjs` build bundled with `pdf-parse`, which is compatible with most environments, including Node.js and modern browsers. If you want to use a more recent version of `pdfjs-dist` or if you want to use a custom build of `pdfjs-dist`, you can do so by providing a custom `pdfjs` function that returns a promise that resolves to the `PDFJS` object.

In the following example we use the "legacy" (see [pdfjs docs](https://github.com/mozilla/pdf.js/wiki/Frequently-Asked-Questions#which-browsersenvironments-are-supported)) build of `pdfjs-dist`, which includes several polyfills not included in the default build.


<CodeGroup>
```bash npm
npm install pdfjs-dist
```
```bash yarn
yarn add pdfjs-dist
```
```bash pnpm
pnpm add pdfjs-dist
```
</CodeGroup>


```typescript
import { PDFLoader } from "@langchain/community/document_loaders/fs/pdf";

const customBuildLoader = new PDFLoader(nike10kPdfPath, {
  // you may need to add `.then(m => m.default)` to the end of the import
  // @lc-ts-ignore
  pdfjs: () => import("pdfjs-dist/legacy/build/pdf.js"),
});
```

## Eliminating extra spaces

PDFs come in many varieties, which makes reading them a challenge. The loader parses individual text elements and joins them together with a space by default, but
if you are seeing excessive spaces, this may not be the desired behavior. In that case, you can override the separator with an empty string like this:

```typescript
import { PDFLoader } from "@langchain/community/document_loaders/fs/pdf";

const noExtraSpacesLoader = new PDFLoader(nike10kPdfPath, {
  parsedItemSeparator: "",
});

const noExtraSpacesDocs = await noExtraSpacesLoader.load();
console.log(noExtraSpacesDocs[0].pageContent.slice(100, 250))
```

```output
(Mark One)
☑ ANNUAL REPORT PURSUANT TO SECTION 13 OR 15(D) OF THE SECURITIES EXCHANGE ACT OF 1934
FOR THE FISCAL YEAR ENDED MAY 31, 2023
OR
☐ TRANSITI
```

## Loading directories

```typescript
import { DirectoryLoader } from "@langchain/classic/document_loaders/fs/directory";
import { PDFLoader } from "@langchain/community/document_loaders/fs/pdf";
import { RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter } from "@langchain/textsplitters";

const exampleDataPath = "../../../../../../examples/src/document_loaders/example_data/";

/* Load all PDFs within the specified directory */
const directoryLoader = new DirectoryLoader(
  exampleDataPath,
  {
    ".pdf": (path: string) => new PDFLoader(path),
  }
);

const directoryDocs = await directoryLoader.load();

console.log(directoryDocs[0]);

/* Additional steps : Split text into chunks with any TextSplitter. You can then use it as context or save it to memory afterwards. */
const textSplitter = new RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter({
  chunkSize: 1000,
  chunkOverlap: 200,
});

const splitDocs = await textSplitter.splitDocuments(directoryDocs);
console.log(splitDocs[0]);
