The `BaiduQianfanEmbeddings` class uses the Baidu Qianfan API to generate embeddings for a given text.

## Setup

An API key is required to use this embedding model. You can get one by registering at https://cloud.baidu.com/doc/WENXINWORKSHOP/s/alj562vvu.

Please set the acquired API key as an environment variable named BAIDU_API_KEY, and set your secret key as an environment variable named BAIDU_SECRET_KEY.

Then, you'll need to install the [`@langchain/baidu-qianfan`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@langchain/baidu-qianfan) package:

<Tip>
See [this section for general instructions on installing LangChain packages](/oss/javascript/langchain/install).
</Tip>

```bash npm
npm install @langchain/baidu-qianfan @langchain/core
```

## Usage

```typescript
import { BaiduQianfanEmbeddings } from "@langchain/baidu-qianfan";

const embeddings = new BaiduQianfanEmbeddings();
const res = await embeddings.embedQuery(
  "What would be a good company name a company that makes colorful socks?"
);
console.log({ res });
```
