title: Cohere
---

<Warning>
**Legacy**

Cohere has marked their `generate` endpoint for LLMs as deprecated. Follow their [migration guide](https://docs.cohere.com/docs/migrating-from-cogenerate-to-cochat) to start using their Chat API via the [`ChatCohere`](/oss/javascript/integrations/chat/cohere) integration.
</Warning>

<Warning>
**You are currently on a page documenting the use of Cohere models as text completion models. Many popular models available on Cohere are [chat completion models](/oss/javascript/langchain/models).**

You may be looking for [this page instead](/oss/javascript/integrations/chat/cohere/).
</Warning>

This will help you get started with Cohere completion models (LLMs) using LangChain. For detailed documentation on `Cohere` features and configuration options, please refer to the [API reference](https://api.js.langchain.com/classes/langchain_cohere.Cohere.html).

## Overview

### Integration details

| Class | Package | Local | Serializable | [PY support](https://python.langchain.com/docs/integrations/llms/cohere) | Downloads | Version |
| :--- | :--- | :---: | :---: |  :---: | :---: | :---: |
| [Cohere](https://api.js.langchain.com/classes/langchain_cohere.Cohere.html) | [@langchain/cohere](https://api.js.langchain.com/modules/langchain_cohere.html) | ❌ | ✅ | ✅ | ![NPM - Downloads](https://img.shields.io/npm/dm/@langchain/cohere?style=flat-square&label=%20&) | ![NPM - Version](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/@langchain/cohere?style=flat-square&label=%20&) |

## Setup

To access Cohere models you'll need to create a Cohere account, get an API key, and install the `@langchain/cohere` integration package.

### Credentials

Head to [cohere.com](https://cohere.com) to sign up to Cohere and generate an API key. Once you've done this set the `COHERE_API_KEY` environment variable:

```bash
export COHERE_API_KEY="your-api-key"
```

If you want to get automated tracing of your model calls you can also set your [LangSmith](https://docs.smith.langchain.com/) API key by uncommenting below:

```bash
# export LANGSMITH_TRACING="true"
# export LANGSMITH_API_KEY="your-api-key"
```

### Installation

The LangChain Cohere integration lives in the `@langchain/cohere` package:

<CodeGroup>
```bash npm
npm install @langchain/cohere @langchain/core
```
```bash yarn
yarn add @langchain/cohere @langchain/core
```
```bash pnpm
pnpm add @langchain/cohere @langchain/core
```
</CodeGroup>

## Instantiation

Now we can instantiate our model object and generate chat completions:

```typescript
import { Cohere } from "@langchain/cohere"

const llm = new Cohere({
  model: "command",
  temperature: 0,
  maxTokens: undefined,
  maxRetries: 2,
  // other params...
})
```

### Custom client for Cohere on Azure, Cohere on AWS Bedrock, and Standalone Cohere Instance

We can instantiate a custom `CohereClient` and pass it to the ChatCohere constructor.

**Note:** If a custom client is provided both `COHERE_API_KEY` environment variable and `apiKey` parameter in the constructor will be ignored.

```typescript
import { Cohere } from "@langchain/cohere";
import { CohereClient } from "cohere-ai";

const client = new CohereClient({
  token: "<your-api-key>",
  environment: "<your-cohere-deployment-url>", //optional
  // other params
});

const llmWithCustomClient = new Cohere({
  client,
  // other params...
});
```

## Invocation

```typescript
const inputText = "Cohere is an AI company that "

const completion = await llm.invoke(inputText)
completion
```

```output
Cohere is a company that provides natural language processing models that help companies improve human-machine interactions. Cohere was founded in 2019 by Aidan Gomez, Ivan Zhang, and Nick Frosst.
```
