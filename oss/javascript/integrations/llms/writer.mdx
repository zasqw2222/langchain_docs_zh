LangChain.js supports calling [WRITER](https://writer.com/) LLMs.

## Setup

First, you'll need to sign up for an account at https://writer.com/. Create a service account and note your API key.

Next, you'll need to install the official package as a peer dependency:

```bash npm
yarn add @writerai/writer-sdk
```
<Tip>
See [this section for general instructions on installing LangChain packages](/oss/javascript/langchain/install).
</Tip>

```bash npm
npm install @langchain/community @langchain/core
```

## Usage

```typescript
import { Writer } from "@langchain/community/llms/writer";

const model = new Writer({
  maxTokens: 20,
  apiKey: "YOUR-API-KEY", // In Node.js defaults to process.env.WRITER_API_KEY
  orgId: "YOUR-ORGANIZATION-ID", // In Node.js defaults to process.env.WRITER_ORG_ID
});
const res = await model.invoke(
  "What would be a good company name a company that makes colorful socks?"
);
console.log({ res });
```
