LangChain supports LLMs hosted by [Deep Infra](https://deepinfra.com/) through the `DeepInfra` wrapper.
First, you'll need to install the `@langchain/community` package:

<Tip>
See [this section for general instructions on installing LangChain packages](/oss/javascript/langchain/install).
</Tip>

```bash npm
npm install @langchain/community @langchain/core
```

You'll need to obtain an API key and set it as an environment variable named `DEEPINFRA_API_TOKEN`
(or pass it into the constructor), then call the model as shown below:

```typescript
import { DeepInfraLLM } from "@langchain/community/llms/deepinfra";

const apiKey = process.env.DEEPINFRA_API_TOKEN;
const model = "meta-llama/Meta-Llama-3-70B-Instruct";

const llm = new DeepInfraLLM({
  temperature: 0.7,
  maxTokens: 20,
  model,
  apiKey,
  maxRetries: 5,
});

const res = await llm.invoke(
  "What is the next step in the process of making a good game?"
);

console.log({ res });
```
