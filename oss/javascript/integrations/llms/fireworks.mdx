<Warning>
**You are currently on a page documenting the use of Fireworks models as text completion models. Many popular models available on Fireworks are [chat completion models](/oss/javascript/langchain/models).**


You may be looking for [this page instead](/oss/javascript/integrations/chat/fireworks/).
</Warning>


[Fireworks AI](https://fireworks.ai/) is an AI inference platform to run and customize models. For a list of all models served by Fireworks see the [Fireworks docs](https://fireworks.ai/models).

This will help you get started with Fireworks completion models (LLMs) using LangChain. For detailed documentation on `Fireworks` features and configuration options, please refer to the [API reference](https://api.js.langchain.com/classes/langchain_community_llms_fireworks.Fireworks.html).

## Overview

### Integration details

| Class | Package | Local | Serializable | [PY support](https://python.langchain.com/docs/integrations/llms/fireworks) | Downloads | Version |
| :--- | :--- | :---: | :---: |  :---: | :---: | :---: |
| [Fireworks](https://api.js.langchain.com/classes/langchain_community_llms_fireworks.Fireworks.html) | [@langchain/community](https://api.js.langchain.com/modules/langchain_community_llms_fireworks.html) | ❌ | ✅ | ✅ | ![NPM - Downloads](https://img.shields.io/npm/dm/@langchain/community?style=flat-square&label=%20&) | ![NPM - Version](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/@langchain/community?style=flat-square&label=%20&) |

## Setup

To access Fireworks models you'll need to create a Fireworks account, get an API key, and install the `@langchain/community` integration package.

### Credentials

Head to [fireworks.ai](https://fireworks.ai/) to sign up to Fireworks and generate an API key. Once you've done this set the `FIREWORKS_API_KEY` environment variable:

```bash
export FIREWORKS_API_KEY="your-api-key"
```

If you want to get automated tracing of your model calls you can also set your [LangSmith](https://docs.smith.langchain.com/) API key by uncommenting below:

```bash
# export LANGSMITH_TRACING="true"
# export LANGSMITH_API_KEY="your-api-key"
```

### Installation

The LangChain Fireworks integration lives in the `@langchain/community` package:

<CodeGroup>
```bash npm
npm install @langchain/community @langchain/core
```
```bash yarn
yarn add @langchain/community @langchain/core
```
```bash pnpm
pnpm add @langchain/community @langchain/core
```
</CodeGroup>

## Instantiation

Now we can instantiate our model object and generate chat completions:

```typescript
import { Fireworks } from "@langchain/community/llms/fireworks"

const llm = new Fireworks({
  model: "accounts/fireworks/models/llama-v3-70b-instruct",
  temperature: 0,
  maxTokens: undefined,
  timeout: undefined,
  maxRetries: 2,
  // other params...
})
```

## Invocation

```typescript
const inputText = "Fireworks is an AI company that "

const completion = await llm.invoke(inputText)
completion
```

```output
 helps businesses automate their customer support using AI-powered chatbots. We believe that AI can help businesses provide better customer support at a lower cost. Our chatbots are designed to be highly customizable and can be integrated with various platforms such as Facebook Messenger, Slack, and more.

We are looking for a talented and motivated **Machine Learning Engineer** to join our team.
