[Elasticsearch](https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch) is a distributed, RESTful search engine optimized for speed and relevance on production-scale workloads. It supports also vector search using the [k-nearest neighbor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K-nearest_neighbors_algorithm) (kNN) algorithm and also [custom models for Natural Language Processing](https://www.elastic.co/blog/how-to-deploy-nlp-text-embeddings-and-vector-search) (NLP).
You can read more about the support of vector search in Elasticsearch [here](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/knn-search.html).

This guide provides a quick overview for getting started with Elasticsearch [vector stores](/oss/javascript/integrations/vectorstores). For detailed documentation of all `ElasticVectorSearch` features and configurations head to the [API reference](https://api.js.langchain.com/classes/langchain_community_vectorstores_elasticsearch.ElasticVectorSearch.html).

## Overview

### Integration details

| Class | Package | [PY support](https://python.langchain.com/docs/integrations/vectorstores/elasticsearch/) |  Version |
| :--- | :--- | :---: | :---: |
| [`ElasticVectorSearch`](https://api.js.langchain.com/classes/langchain_community_vectorstores_elasticsearch.ElasticVectorSearch.html) | [`@langchain/community`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@langchain/community) | ✅ |  ![NPM - Version](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/@langchain/community?style=flat-square&label=%20&) |

## Setup

To use Elasticsearch vector stores, you'll need to install the `@langchain/community` integration package.

LangChain.js accepts [`@elastic/elasticsearch`](https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch-js) as the client for Elasticsearch vectorstore. You'll need to install it as a peer dependency.

This guide will also use [OpenAI embeddings](/oss/javascript/integrations/text_embedding/openai), which require you to install the `@langchain/openai` integration package. You can also use [other supported embeddings models](/oss/javascript/integrations/text_embedding) if you wish.

<CodeGroup>
```bash npm
npm install @langchain/community @elastic/elasticsearch @langchain/openai @langchain/core
```
```bash yarn
yarn add @langchain/community @elastic/elasticsearch @langchain/openai @langchain/core
```
```bash pnpm
pnpm add @langchain/community @elastic/elasticsearch @langchain/openai @langchain/core
```
</CodeGroup>

### Credentials

To use Elasticsearch vector stores, you'll need to have an Elasticsearch instance running.

You can use the [official Docker image](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/docker.html) to get started, or you can use [Elastic Cloud](https://www.elastic.co/cloud/), Elastic's official cloud service.

For connecting to Elastic Cloud you can read the documentation reported [here](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/kibana/current/api-keys.html) for obtaining an API key.

If you are using OpenAI embeddings for this guide, you'll need to set your OpenAI key as well:

```typescript
process.env.OPENAI_API_KEY = "YOUR_API_KEY";
```

If you want to get automated tracing of your model calls you can also set your [LangSmith](https://docs.smith.langchain.com/) API key by uncommenting below:

```typescript
// process.env.LANGSMITH_TRACING="true"
// process.env.LANGSMITH_API_KEY="your-api-key"
```

## Instantiation

Instatiating Elasticsearch will vary depending on where your instance is hosted.

```typescript
import {
  ElasticVectorSearch,
  type ElasticClientArgs,
} from "@langchain/community/vectorstores/elasticsearch";
import { OpenAIEmbeddings } from "@langchain/openai";

import { Client, type ClientOptions } from "@elastic/elasticsearch";

import * as fs from "node:fs";

const embeddings = new OpenAIEmbeddings({
  model: "text-embedding-3-small",
});

const config: ClientOptions = {
  node: process.env.ELASTIC_URL ?? "https://127.0.0.1:9200",
};

if (process.env.ELASTIC_API_KEY) {
  config.auth = {
    apiKey: process.env.ELASTIC_API_KEY,
  };
} else if (process.env.ELASTIC_USERNAME && process.env.ELASTIC_PASSWORD) {
  config.auth = {
    username: process.env.ELASTIC_USERNAME,
    password: process.env.ELASTIC_PASSWORD,
  };
}
// Local Docker deploys require a TLS certificate
if (process.env.ELASTIC_CERT_PATH) {
  config.tls = {
    ca: fs.readFileSync(process.env.ELASTIC_CERT_PATH),
    rejectUnauthorized: false,
  }
}
const clientArgs: ElasticClientArgs = {
  client: new Client(config),
  indexName: process.env.ELASTIC_INDEX ?? "test_vectorstore",
};

const vectorStore = new ElasticVectorSearch(embeddings, clientArgs);
```

## Manage vector store

### Add items to vector store

```typescript
import type { Document } from "@langchain/core/documents";

const document1: Document = {
  pageContent: "The powerhouse of the cell is the mitochondria",
  metadata: { source: "https://example.com" }
};

const document2: Document = {
  pageContent: "Buildings are made out of brick",
  metadata: { source: "https://example.com" }
};

const document3: Document = {
  pageContent: "Mitochondria are made out of lipids",
  metadata: { source: "https://example.com" }
};

const document4: Document = {
  pageContent: "The 2024 Olympics are in Paris",
  metadata: { source: "https://example.com" }
}

const documents = [document1, document2, document3, document4];

await vectorStore.addDocuments(documents, { ids: ["1", "2", "3", "4"] });
```

```output
[ '1', '2', '3', '4' ]
```

### Delete items from vector store

You can delete values from the store by passing the same id you passed in:

```typescript
await vectorStore.delete({ ids: ["4"] });
```

## Query vector store

Once your vector store has been created and the relevant documents have been added you will most likely wish to query it during the running of your chain or agent.

### Query directly

Performing a simple similarity search can be done as follows:

```typescript
const filter = [{
  operator: "match",
  field: "source",
  value: "https://example.com",
}];

const similaritySearchResults = await vectorStore.similaritySearch("biology", 2, filter);

for (const doc of similaritySearchResults) {
  console.log(`* ${doc.pageContent} [${JSON.stringify(doc.metadata, null)}]`);
}
```

```output
* The powerhouse of the cell is the mitochondria [{"source":"https://example.com"}]
* Mitochondria are made out of lipids [{"source":"https://example.com"}]
```

The vector store supports [Elasticsearch filter syntax](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/query-filter-context.html) operators.

If you want to execute a similarity search and receive the corresponding scores you can run:

```typescript
const similaritySearchWithScoreResults = await vectorStore.similaritySearchWithScore("biology", 2, filter)

for (const [doc, score] of similaritySearchWithScoreResults) {
  console.log(`* [SIM=${score.toFixed(3)}] ${doc.pageContent} [${JSON.stringify(doc.metadata)}]`);
}
```

```output
* [SIM=0.374] The powerhouse of the cell is the mitochondria [{"source":"https://example.com"}]
* [SIM=0.370] Mitochondria are made out of lipids [{"source":"https://example.com"}]
```

### Query by turning into retriever

You can also transform the vector store into a [retriever](/oss/javascript/langchain/retrieval) for easier usage in your chains.

```typescript
const retriever = vectorStore.asRetriever({
  // Optional filter
  filter: filter,
  k: 2,
});
await retriever.invoke("biology");
```

```output
[
  Document {
    pageContent: 'The powerhouse of the cell is the mitochondria',
    metadata: { source: 'https://example.com' },
    id: undefined
  },
  Document {
    pageContent: 'Mitochondria are made out of lipids',
    metadata: { source: 'https://example.com' },
    id: undefined
  }
]
```
