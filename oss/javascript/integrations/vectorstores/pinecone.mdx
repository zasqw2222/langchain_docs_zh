title: PineconeStore
---

[Pinecone](https://www.pinecone.io/) is a vector database that helps power AI for some of the world’s best companies.

This guide provides a quick overview for getting started with Pinecone [vector stores](/oss/javascript/integrations/vectorstores). For detailed documentation of all `PineconeStore` features and configurations head to the [API reference](https://api.js.langchain.com/classes/langchain_pinecone.PineconeStore.html).

## Overview

### Integration details

| Class | Package | [PY support](https://python.langchain.com/docs/integrations/vectorstores/pinecone/) | Version |
| :--- | :--- | :---: | :---: |
| [`PineconeStore`](https://api.js.langchain.com/classes/langchain_pinecone.PineconeStore.html) | [`@langchain/pinecone`](https://npmjs.com/@langchain/pinecone) | ✅ |  ![NPM - Version](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/@langchain/pinecone?style=flat-square&label=%20&) |

## Setup

To use Pinecone vector stores, you'll need to create a Pinecone account, initialize an index, and install the `@langchain/pinecone` integration package. You'll also want to install the [official Pinecone SDK](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@pinecone-database/pinecone) to initialize a client to pass into the `PineconeStore` instance.

This guide will also use [OpenAI embeddings](/oss/javascript/integrations/text_embedding/openai), which require you to install the `@langchain/openai` integration package. You can also use [other supported embeddings models](/oss/javascript/integrations/text_embedding) if you wish.

<CodeGroup>
```bash npm
npm install @langchain/pinecone @langchain/openai @langchain/core @pinecone-database/pinecone@5
```
```bash yarn
yarn add @langchain/pinecone @langchain/openai @langchain/core @pinecone-database/pinecone@5
```
```bash pnpm
pnpm add @langchain/pinecone @langchain/openai @langchain/core @pinecone-database/pinecone@5
```
</CodeGroup>

### Credentials

Sign up for a [Pinecone](https://www.pinecone.io/) account and create an index. Make sure the dimensions match those of the embeddings you want to use (the default is 1536 for OpenAI's `text-embedding-3-small`). Once you've done this set the `PINECONE_INDEX`, `PINECONE_API_KEY`, and (optionally) `PINECONE_ENVIRONMENT` environment variables:

```typescript
process.env.PINECONE_API_KEY = "your-pinecone-api-key";
process.env.PINECONE_INDEX = "your-pinecone-index";

// Optional
process.env.PINECONE_ENVIRONMENT = "your-pinecone-environment";
```

If you are using OpenAI embeddings for this guide, you'll need to set your OpenAI key as well:

```typescript
process.env.OPENAI_API_KEY = "YOUR_API_KEY";
```

If you want to get automated tracing of your model calls you can also set your [LangSmith](https://docs.smith.langchain.com/) API key by uncommenting below:

```typescript
// process.env.LANGSMITH_TRACING="true"
// process.env.LANGSMITH_API_KEY="your-api-key"
```

## Instantiation

```typescript
import { PineconeStore } from "@langchain/pinecone";
import { OpenAIEmbeddings } from "@langchain/openai";

import { Pinecone as PineconeClient } from "@pinecone-database/pinecone";

const embeddings = new OpenAIEmbeddings({
  model: "text-embedding-3-small",
});

const pinecone = new PineconeClient();
// Will automatically read the PINECONE_API_KEY and PINECONE_ENVIRONMENT env vars
const pineconeIndex = pinecone.Index(process.env.PINECONE_INDEX!);

const vectorStore = await PineconeStore.fromExistingIndex(
  embeddings,
  {
    pineconeIndex,
    // Maximum number of batch requests to allow at once. Each batch is 1000 vectors.
    maxConcurrency: 5,
    // You can pass a namespace here too
    // namespace: "foo",
  }
);
```

## Manage vector store

### Add items to vector store

```typescript
import type { Document } from "@langchain/core/documents";

const document1: Document = {
  pageContent: "The powerhouse of the cell is the mitochondria",
  metadata: { source: "https://example.com" }
};

const document2: Document = {
  pageContent: "Buildings are made out of brick",
  metadata: { source: "https://example.com" }
};

const document3: Document = {
  pageContent: "Mitochondria are made out of lipids",
  metadata: { source: "https://example.com" }
};

const document4: Document = {
  pageContent: "The 2024 Olympics are in Paris",
  metadata: { source: "https://example.com" }
}

const documents = [document1, document2, document3, document4];

await vectorStore.addDocuments(documents, { ids: ["1", "2", "3", "4"] });
```

```output
[ '1', '2', '3', '4' ]
```

**Note:** After adding documents, there is a slight delay before they become queryable.

### Delete items from vector store

```typescript
await vectorStore.delete({ ids: ["4"] });
```

## Query vector store

Once your vector store has been created and the relevant documents have been added you will most likely wish to query it during the running of your chain or agent.

### Query directly

Performing a simple similarity search can be done as follows:

```typescript
// Optional filter
const filter = { source: "https://example.com" };

const similaritySearchResults = await vectorStore.similaritySearch("biology", 2, filter);

for (const doc of similaritySearchResults) {
  console.log(`* ${doc.pageContent} [${JSON.stringify(doc.metadata, null)}]`);
}
```

```output
* The powerhouse of the cell is the mitochondria [{"source":"https://example.com"}]
* Mitochondria are made out of lipids [{"source":"https://example.com"}]
```

If you want to execute a similarity search and receive the corresponding scores you can run:

```typescript
const similaritySearchWithScoreResults = await vectorStore.similaritySearchWithScore("biology", 2, filter)

for (const [doc, score] of similaritySearchWithScoreResults) {
  console.log(`* [SIM=${score.toFixed(3)}] ${doc.pageContent} [${JSON.stringify(doc.metadata)}]`);
}
```

```output
* [SIM=0.165] The powerhouse of the cell is the mitochondria [{"source":"https://example.com"}]
* [SIM=0.148] Mitochondria are made out of lipids [{"source":"https://example.com"}]
```

### Query by turning into retriever

You can also transform the vector store into a [retriever](/oss/javascript/langchain/retrieval) for easier usage in your chains.

```typescript
const retriever = vectorStore.asRetriever({
  // Optional filter
  filter: filter,
  k: 2,
});

await retriever.invoke("biology");
```

```output
[
  Document {
    pageContent: 'The powerhouse of the cell is the mitochondria',
    metadata: { source: 'https://example.com' },
    id: undefined
  },
  Document {
    pageContent: 'Mitochondria are made out of lipids',
    metadata: { source: 'https://example.com' },
    id: undefined
  }
]
```
