> [Friendli](https://friendli.ai/) enhances AI application performance and optimizes cost savings with scalable, efficient deployment options, tailored for high-demand AI workloads.

This tutorial guides you through integrating `ChatFriendli` for chat applications using LangChain. `ChatFriendli` offers a flexible approach to generating conversational AI responses, supporting both synchronous and asynchronous calls.

## Setup

Ensure the `@langchain/community` is installed.

<Tip>
See [this section for general instructions on installing LangChain packages](/oss/javascript/langchain/install).
</Tip>

```bash npm
npm install @langchain/community @langchain/core
```

Sign in to [Friendli Suite](https://suite.friendli.ai/) to create a Personal Access Token, and set it as the `FRIENDLI_TOKEN` environment.
You can set team id as `FRIENDLI_TEAM` environment.

You can initialize a Friendli chat model with selecting the model you want to use. The default model is `meta-llama-3-8b-instruct`. You can check the available models at [docs.friendli.ai](https://docs.friendli.ai/guides/serverless_endpoints/pricing#text-generation-models).

## Usage

```typescript
import { ChatFriendli } from "@langchain/community/chat_models/friendli";

const model = new ChatFriendli({
  model: "meta-llama-3-8b-instruct", // Default value
  friendliToken: process.env.FRIENDLI_TOKEN,
  friendliTeam: process.env.FRIENDLI_TEAM,
  maxTokens: 800,
  temperature: 0.9,
  topP: 0.9,
  frequencyPenalty: 0,
  stop: [],
});

const response = await model.invoke(
  "Draft a cover letter for a role in software engineering."
);

console.log(response.content);

/*

*/

const stream = await model.stream(
  "Draft a cover letter for a role in software engineering."
);

for await (const chunk of stream) {
  console.log(chunk.content);
}

/*

```
