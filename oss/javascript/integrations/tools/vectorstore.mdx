title: VectorStoreToolkit
---

This will help you getting started with the [VectorStoreToolkit](/oss/javascript/langchain/tools#toolkits). For detailed documentation of all VectorStoreToolkit features and configurations head to the [API reference](https://api.js.langchain.com/classes/langchain.agents.VectorStoreToolkit.html).

The `VectorStoreToolkit` is a toolkit which takes in a vector store, and converts it to a tool which can then be invoked, passed to LLMs, agents and more.

## Setup

If you want to get automated tracing from runs of individual tools, you can also set your [LangSmith](https://docs.smith.langchain.com/) API key by uncommenting below:

```typescript
process.env.LANGSMITH_TRACING="true"
process.env.LANGSMITH_API_KEY="your-api-key"
```

### Installation

This toolkit lives in the `langchain` package:

<CodeGroup>
```bash npm
npm install langchain @langchain/core
```
```bash yarn
yarn add langchain @langchain/core
```
```bash pnpm
pnpm add langchain @langchain/core
```
</CodeGroup>

## Instantiation

Now we can instantiate our toolkit. First, we need to define the LLM we'll use in the toolkit.

```typescript
// @lc-docs-hide-cell

import { ChatOpenAI } from "@langchain/openai";

const llm = new ChatOpenAI({
  model: "gpt-4o-mini",
  temperature: 0,
})
```

```typescript
import { VectorStoreToolkit, VectorStoreInfo } from "@langchain/classic/agents/toolkits"
import { OpenAIEmbeddings } from "@langchain/openai"
import { MemoryVectorStore } from "@langchain/classic/vectorstores/memory"
import { RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter } from "@langchain/textsplitters";
import fs from "fs";

// Load a text file to use as our data source.
const text = fs.readFileSync("../../../../../examples/state_of_the_union.txt", "utf8");

// Split the text into chunks before inserting to our store
const textSplitter = new RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter({ chunkSize: 1000 });
const docs = await textSplitter.createDocuments([text]);

const vectorStore = await MemoryVectorStore.fromDocuments(docs, new OpenAIEmbeddings());

const vectorStoreInfo: VectorStoreInfo = {
  name: "state_of_union_address",
  description: "the most recent state of the Union address",
  vectorStore,
};

const toolkit = new VectorStoreToolkit(vectorStoreInfo, llm);
```

## Tools

Here, we can see it converts our vector store into a tool:

```typescript
const tools = toolkit.getTools();

console.log(tools.map((tool) => ({
  name: tool.name,
  description: tool.description,
})))
```

```output
[
  {
    name: 'state_of_union_address',
    description: 'Useful for when you need to answer questions about state_of_union_address. Whenever you need information about the most recent state of the Union address you should ALWAYS use this. Input should be a fully formed question.'
  }
]
```

## Use within an agent

First, ensure you have LangGraph installed:


<CodeGroup>
```bash npm
npm install @langchain/langgraph
```
```bash yarn
yarn add @langchain/langgraph
```
```bash pnpm
pnpm add @langchain/langgraph
```
</CodeGroup>


Then, instantiate the agent:

```typescript
import { createAgent } from "@langchain/classic"

const agentExecutor = createAgent({ llm, tools });
```

```typescript
const exampleQuery = "What did biden say about Ketanji Brown Jackson is the state of the union address?"

const events = await agentExecutor.stream(
  { messages: [["user", exampleQuery]]},
  { streamMode: "values", }
)

for await (const event of events) {
  const lastMsg = event.messages[event.messages.length - 1];
  if (lastMsg.tool_calls?.length) {
    console.dir(lastMsg.tool_calls, { depth: null });
  } else if (lastMsg.content) {
    console.log(lastMsg.content);
  }
}
```

```output
[
  {
    name: 'state_of_union_address',
    args: {
      input: 'What did Biden say about Ketanji Brown Jackson in the State of the Union address?'
    },
    type: 'tool_call',
    id: 'call_glJSWLNrftKHa92A6j8x4jhd'
  }
]
In the State of the Union address, Biden mentioned that he nominated Circuit Court of Appeals Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson, describing her as one of the nation’s top legal minds who will continue Justice Breyer’s legacy of excellence. He highlighted her background as a former top litigator in private practice, a former federal public defender, and noted that she comes from a family of public school educators and police officers. He also pointed out that she has received a broad range of support since her nomination.
