title: Dria Retriever
---

The [Dria](https://dria.co/) retriever allows an agent to perform a text-based search across a comprehensive knowledge hub.

## Setup

To use Dria retriever, first install Dria JS client:

```bash npm
npm install dria
```
You need to provide two things to the retriever:

- **API Key**: you can get yours at your [profile page](https://dria.co/) when you create an account.
- **Contract ID**: accessible at the top of the page when viewing a knowledge or in its URL.
  For example, the Bitcoin whitepaper is uploaded on Dria at https://dria.co/knowledge/2KxNbEb040GKQ1DSDNDsA-Fsj_BlQIEAlzBNuiapBR0, so its contract ID is `2KxNbEb040GKQ1DSDNDsA-Fsj_BlQIEAlzBNuiapBR0`.
    Contract ID can be omitted during instantiation, and later be set via `dria.contractId = "your-contract"`

Dria retriever exposes the underlying [Dria client](https://npmjs.com/package/dria) as well, refer to the [Dria documentation](https://github.com/firstbatchxyz/dria-js-client?tab=readme-ov-file#usage) to learn more about the client.

## Usage

<Tip>
See [this section for general instructions on installing LangChain packages](/oss/javascript/langchain/install).
</Tip>

```bash npm
npm install dria @langchain/community @langchain/core
```

```typescript
import { DriaRetriever } from "@langchain/community/retrievers/dria";

// contract of TypeScript Handbook v4.9 uploaded to Dria
// https://dria.co/knowledge/-B64DjhUtCwBdXSpsRytlRQCu-bie-vSTvTIT8Ap3g0
const contractId = "-B64DjhUtCwBdXSpsRytlRQCu-bie-vSTvTIT8Ap3g0";

const retriever = new DriaRetriever({
  contractId, // a knowledge to connect to
  apiKey: "DRIA_API_KEY", // if not provided, will check env for `DRIA_API_KEY`
  topK: 15, // optional: default value is 10
});

const docs = await retriever.invoke("What is a union type?");
console.log(docs);
```
