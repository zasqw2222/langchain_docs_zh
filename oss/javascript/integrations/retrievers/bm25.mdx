BM25, also known as [Okapi BM25](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Okapi_BM25), is a ranking function used in information retrieval systems to estimate the relevance of documents to a given search query.

You can use it as part of your retrieval pipeline as a to rerank documents as a postprocessing step after retrieving an initial set of documents from another source.

## Setup

The `BM25Retriever` is exported from `@langchain/community`. You'll need to install it like this:

<CodeGroup>
```bash npm
npm install @langchain/community @langchain/core
```
```bash yarn
yarn add @langchain/community @langchain/core
```
```bash pnpm
pnpm add @langchain/community @langchain/core
```
</CodeGroup>

This retriever uses code from [`this implementation`](https://github.com/FurkanToprak/OkapiBM25) of Okapi BM25.

## Usage

You can now create a new retriever with previously retrieved documents:

```typescript
import { BM25Retriever } from "@langchain/community/retrievers/bm25";

const retriever = BM25Retriever.fromDocuments([
  { pageContent: "Buildings are made out of brick", metadata: {} },
  { pageContent: "Buildings are made out of wood", metadata: {} },
  { pageContent: "Buildings are made out of stone", metadata: {} },
  { pageContent: "Cars are made out of metal", metadata: {} },
  { pageContent: "Cars are made out of plastic", metadata: {} },
  { pageContent: "mitochondria is the powerhouse of the cell", metadata: {} },
  { pageContent: "mitochondria is made of lipids", metadata: {} },
], { k: 4 });

// Will return the 4 documents reranked by the BM25 algorithm
await retriever.invoke("mitochondria");
```

```output
[
  { pageContent: 'mitochondria is made of lipids', metadata: {} },
  {
    pageContent: 'mitochondria is the powerhouse of the cell',
    metadata: {}
  },
  { pageContent: 'Buildings are made out of brick', metadata: {} },
  { pageContent: 'Buildings are made out of wood', metadata: {} }
]
```

```typescript

```
