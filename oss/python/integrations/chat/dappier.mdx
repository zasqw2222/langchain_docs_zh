This example goes over how to use LangChain to interact with Dappier AI models

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

To use one of our Dappier AI Data Models, you will need an API key. Please visit Dappier Platform ([platform.dappier.com/](https://platform.dappier.com/)) to log in and create an API key in your profile.

You can find more details on the API reference : [docs.dappier.com/introduction](https://docs.dappier.com/introduction)

To work with our Dappier Chat Model you can pass the key directly through the parameter named dappier_api_key when initiating the class
or set as an environment variable.

```bash
export DAPPIER_API_KEY="..."
```

```python
from langchain_community.chat_models.dappier import ChatDappierAI
from langchain.messages import HumanMessage
```

```python
chat = ChatDappierAI(
    dappier_endpoint="https://api.dappier.com/app/datamodelconversation",
    dappier_model="dm_01hpsxyfm2fwdt2zet9cg6fdxt",
    dappier_api_key="...",
)
```

```python
messages = [HumanMessage(content="Who won the super bowl in 2024?")]
chat.invoke(messages)
```

```output
AIMessage(content='Hey there! The Kansas City Chiefs won Super Bowl LVIII in 2024. They beat the San Francisco 49ers in overtime with a final score of 25-22. It was quite the game! 🏈')
```

```python
await chat.ainvoke(messages)
```

```output
AIMessage(content='The Kansas City Chiefs won Super Bowl LVIII in 2024! 🏈')
```

```python
```

```python

```
