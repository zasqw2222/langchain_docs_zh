title: Model2Vec
---

Model2Vec is a technique to turn any sentence transformer into a really small static model
[model2vec](https://github.com/MinishLab/model2vec) can be used to generate embeddings.

## Setup

```bash
pip install -U langchain-community
```

## Instantiation

Ensure that `model2vec` is installed

```bash
pip install -U model2vec
```

## Indexing and Retrieval

```python
from langchain_community.embeddings import Model2vecEmbeddings
```

```python
embeddings = Model2vecEmbeddings("minishlab/potion-base-8M")
```

```python
query_text = "This is a test query."
query_result = embeddings.embed_query(query_text)
```

```python
document_text = "This is a test document."
document_result = embeddings.embed_documents([document_text])
```

## Direct Usage

Here's how you would directly make use of `model2vec`

```python
from model2vec import StaticModel

# Load a model from the HuggingFace hub (in this case the potion-base-8M model)
model = StaticModel.from_pretrained("minishlab/potion-base-8M")

# Make embeddings
embeddings = model.encode(["It's dangerous to go alone!", "It's a secret to everybody."])

# Make sequences of token embeddings
token_embeddings = model.encode_as_sequence(["It's dangerous to go alone!", "It's a secret to everybody."])
```
