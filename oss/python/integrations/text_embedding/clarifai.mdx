>[Clarifai](https://www.clarifai.com/) is an AI Platform that provides the full AI lifecycle ranging from data exploration, data labeling, model training, evaluation, and inference.

This example goes over how to use LangChain to interact with `Clarifai` [models](https://clarifai.com/explore/models). Text embedding models in particular can be found [here](https://clarifai.com/explore/models?page=1&perPage=24&filterData=%5B%7B%22field%22%3A%22model_type_id%22%2C%22value%22%3A%5B%22text-embedder%22%5D%7D%5D).

To use Clarifai, you must have an account and a Personal Access Token (PAT) key.
[Check here](https://clarifai.com/settings/security) to get or create a PAT.

# Dependencies

```python
# Install required dependencies
pip install -qU  clarifai
```

# Imports

Here we will be setting the personal access token. You can find your PAT under [settings/security](https://clarifai.com/settings/security) in your Clarifai account.

```python
# Please login and get your API key from  https://clarifai.com/settings/security
from getpass import getpass

CLARIFAI_PAT = getpass()
```

```python
# Import the required modules
from langchain.chains import LLMChain
from langchain_community.embeddings import ClarifaiEmbeddings
from langchain_core.prompts import PromptTemplate
```

# Input

Create a prompt template to be used with the LLM Chain:

```python
template = """Question: {question}

Answer: Let's think step by step."""

prompt = PromptTemplate.from_template(template)
```

# Setup

Set the user id and app id to the application in which the model resides. You can find a list of public models on [clarifai.com/explore/models](https://clarifai.com/explore/models)

You will have to also initialize the model id and if needed, the model version id. Some models have many versions, you can choose the one appropriate for your task.

```python
USER_ID = "clarifai"
APP_ID = "main"
MODEL_ID = "BAAI-bge-base-en-v15"
MODEL_URL = "https://clarifai.com/clarifai/main/models/BAAI-bge-base-en-v15"

# Further you can also provide a specific model version as the model_version_id arg.
# MODEL_VERSION_ID = "MODEL_VERSION_ID"
```

```python
# Initialize a Clarifai embedding model
embeddings = ClarifaiEmbeddings(user_id=USER_ID, app_id=APP_ID, model_id=MODEL_ID)

# Initialize a clarifai embedding model using model URL
embeddings = ClarifaiEmbeddings(model_url=MODEL_URL)

# Alternatively you can initialize clarifai class with pat argument.
```

```python
text = "roses are red violets are blue."
text2 = "Make hay while the sun shines."
```

You can embed single line of your text using embed_query function !

```python
query_result = embeddings.embed_query(text)
```

Further to embed list of texts/documents use embed_documents function.

```python
doc_result = embeddings.embed_documents([text, text2])
```
