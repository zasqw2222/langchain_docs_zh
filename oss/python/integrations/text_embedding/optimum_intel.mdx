title: Embedding Documents using Optimized and Quantized Embedders
---

Embedding all documents using Quantized Embedders.

The embedders are based on optimized models, created by using [optimum-intel](https://github.com/huggingface/optimum-intel.git) and [IPEX](https://github.com/intel/intel-extension-for-pytorch).

Example text is based on [SBERT](https://www.sbert.net/docs/pretrained_cross-encoders.html).

```python
from langchain_community.embeddings import QuantizedBiEncoderEmbeddings

model_name = "Intel/bge-small-en-v1.5-rag-int8-static"
encode_kwargs = {"normalize_embeddings": True}  # set True to compute cosine similarity

model = QuantizedBiEncoderEmbeddings(
    model_name=model_name,
    encode_kwargs=encode_kwargs,
    query_instruction="Represent this sentence for searching relevant passages: ",
)
```

```output
loading configuration file inc_config.json from cache at
INCConfig {
  "distillation": {},
  "neural_compressor_version": "2.4.1",
  "optimum_version": "1.16.2",
  "pruning": {},
  "quantization": {
    "dataset_num_samples": 50,
    "is_static": true
  },
  "save_onnx_model": false,
  "torch_version": "2.2.0",
  "transformers_version": "4.37.2"
}

Using `INCModel` to load a TorchScript model will be deprecated in v1.15.0, to load your model please use `IPEXModel` instead.
```

Let's ask a question, and compare to 2 documents. The first contains the answer to the question, and the second one does not.

We can check better suits our query.

```python
question = "How many people live in Berlin?"
```

```python
documents = [
    "Berlin had a population of 3,520,031 registered inhabitants in an area of 891.82 square kilometers.",
    "Berlin is well known for its museums.",
]
```

```python
doc_vecs = model.embed_documents(documents)
```

```output
Batches: 100%|██████████| 1/1 [00:00<00:00,  4.18it/s]
```

```python
query_vec = model.embed_query(question)
```

```python
import torch
```

```python
doc_vecs_torch = torch.tensor(doc_vecs)
```

```python
query_vec_torch = torch.tensor(query_vec)
```

```python
query_vec_torch @ doc_vecs_torch.T
```

```output
tensor([0.7980, 0.6529])
```

We can see that indeed the first one ranks higher.
