title: Airbyte Hubspot (Deprecated)
---

Note: `AirbyteHubspotLoader` is deprecated. Please use [`AirbyteLoader`](/oss/python/integrations/document_loaders/airbyte) instead.

>[Airbyte](https://github.com/airbytehq/airbyte) is a data integration platform for ELT pipelines from APIs, databases & files to warehouses & lakes. It has the largest catalog of ELT connectors to data warehouses and databases.

This loader exposes the Hubspot connector as a document loader, allowing you to load various Hubspot objects as documents.

## Installation

First, you need to install the `airbyte-source-hubspot` python package.

```python
pip install -qU  airbyte-source-hubspot
```

## Example

Check out the [Airbyte documentation page](https://docs.airbyte.com/integrations/sources/hubspot/) for details about how to configure the reader.
The JSON schema the config object should adhere to can be found on Github: [https://github.com/airbytehq/airbyte/blob/master/airbyte-integrations/connectors/source-hubspot/source_hubspot/spec.yaml](https://github.com/airbytehq/airbyte/blob/master/airbyte-integrations/connectors/source-hubspot/source_hubspot/spec.yaml).

The general shape looks like this:

```python
{
  "start_date": "<date from which to start retrieving records from in ISO format, e.g. 2020-10-20T00:00:00Z>",
  "credentials": {
    "credentials_title": "Private App Credentials",
    "access_token": "<access token of your private app>"
  }
}
```

By default all fields are stored as metadata in the documents and the text is set to an empty string. Construct the text of the document by transforming the documents returned by the reader.

```python
from langchain_community.document_loaders.airbyte import AirbyteHubspotLoader

config = {
    # your hubspot configuration
}

loader = AirbyteHubspotLoader(
    config=config, stream_name="products"
)  # check the documentation linked above for a list of all streams
```

Now you can load documents the usual way

```python
docs = loader.load()
```

As `load` returns a list, it will block until all documents are loaded. To have better control over this process, you can also use the `lazy_load` method which returns an iterator instead:

```python
docs_iterator = loader.lazy_load()
```

Keep in mind that by default the page content is empty and the metadata object contains all the information from the record. To process documents, create a class inheriting from the base loader and implement the `_handle_records` method yourself:

```python
from langchain_core.documents import Document


def handle_record(record, id):
    return Document(page_content=record.data["title"], metadata=record.data)


loader = AirbyteHubspotLoader(
    config=config, record_handler=handle_record, stream_name="products"
)
docs = loader.load()
```

## Incremental loads

Some streams allow incremental loading, this means the source keeps track of synced records and won't load them again. This is useful for sources that have a high volume of data and are updated frequently.

To take advantage of this, store the `last_state` property of the loader and pass it in when creating the loader again. This will ensure that only new records are loaded.

```python
last_state = loader.last_state  # store safely

incremental_loader = AirbyteHubspotLoader(
    config=config, stream_name="products", state=last_state
)

new_docs = incremental_loader.load()
```
