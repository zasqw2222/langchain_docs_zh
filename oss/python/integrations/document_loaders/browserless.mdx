title: Browserless
---

Browserless is a service that allows you to run headless Chrome instances in the cloud. It's a great way to run browser-based automation at scale without having to worry about managing your own infrastructure.

To use Browserless as a document loader, initialize a `BrowserlessLoader` instance as shown in this notebook. Note that by default, `BrowserlessLoader` returns the `innerText` of the page's `body` element. To disable this and get the raw HTML, set `text_content` to `False`.

```python
from langchain_community.document_loaders import BrowserlessLoader
```

```python
BROWSERLESS_API_TOKEN = "YOUR_BROWSERLESS_API_TOKEN"
```

```python
loader = BrowserlessLoader(
    api_token=BROWSERLESS_API_TOKEN,
    urls=[
        "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Document_classification",
    ],
    text_content=True,
)

documents = loader.load()

print(documents[0].page_content[:1000])
```

From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia

Document classification or document categorization is a problem in library science, information science and computer science. The task is to assign a document to one or more classes or categories. This may be done "manually" (or "intellectually") or algorithmically. The intellectual classification of documents has mostly been the province of library science, while the algorithmic classification of documents is mainly in information science and computer science. The problems are overlapping, however, and there is therefore interdisciplinary research on document classification.

The documents to be classified may be texts, images, music, etc. Each kind of document possesses its special classification problems. When not otherwise specified, text classification is implied.
