title: Google Cloud Storage Directory
---

>[Google Cloud Storage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Cloud_Storage) is a managed service for storing unstructured data.

This covers how to load document objects from an `Google Cloud Storage (GCS) directory (bucket)`.

```python
pip install -qU  langchain-google-community[gcs]
```

```python
from langchain_google_community import GCSDirectoryLoader
```

```python
loader = GCSDirectoryLoader(project_name="aist", bucket="testing-hwc")
```

```python
loader.load()
```

```output
/Users/harrisonchase/workplace/langchain/.venv/lib/python3.10/site-packages/google/auth/_default.py:83: UserWarning: Your application has authenticated using end user credentials from Google Cloud SDK without a quota project. You might receive a "quota exceeded" or "API not enabled" error. We recommend you rerun `gcloud auth application-default login` and make sure a quota project is added. Or you can use service accounts instead. For more information about service accounts, see https://cloud.google.com/docs/authentication/
  warnings.warn(_CLOUD_SDK_CREDENTIALS_WARNING)

```

```output
[Document(page_content='Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet.', lookup_str='', metadata={'source': '/var/folders/y6/8_bzdg295ld6s1_97_12m4lr0000gn/T/tmpz37njh7u/fake.docx'}, lookup_index=0)]
```

## Specifying a prefix

You can also specify a prefix for more fine-grained control over what files to load -including loading all files from a specific folder-.

```python
loader = GCSDirectoryLoader(project_name="aist", bucket="testing-hwc", prefix="fake")
```

```python
loader.load()
```

```output
/Users/harrisonchase/workplace/langchain/.venv/lib/python3.10/site-packages/google/auth/_default.py:83: UserWarning: Your application has authenticated using end user credentials from Google Cloud SDK without a quota project. You might receive a "quota exceeded" or "API not enabled" error. We recommend you rerun `gcloud auth application-default login` and make sure a quota project is added. Or you can use service accounts instead. For more information about service accounts, see https://cloud.google.com/docs/authentication/
  warnings.warn(_CLOUD_SDK_CREDENTIALS_WARNING)

```

## Continue on failure to load a single file

Files in a GCS bucket may cause errors during processing. Enable the `continue_on_failure=True` argument to allow silent failure. This means failure to process a single file will not break the function, it will log a warning instead.

```python
loader = GCSDirectoryLoader(
    project_name="aist", bucket="testing-hwc", continue_on_failure=True
)
```

```python
loader.load()
```
