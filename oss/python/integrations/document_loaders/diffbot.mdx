>[Diffbot](https://docs.diffbot.com/docs/getting-started-with-diffbot) is a suite of ML-based products that make it easy to structure web data.

>Diffbot's [Extract API](https://docs.diffbot.com/reference/extract-introduction) is a service that structures and normalizes data from web pages.

>Unlike traditional web scraping tools, `Diffbot Extract` doesn't require any rules to read the content on a page. It uses a computer vision model to classify a page into one of 20 possible types, and then transforms raw HTML markup into JSON. The resulting structured JSON follows a consistent [type-based ontology](https://docs.diffbot.com/docs/ontology), which makes it easy to extract data from multiple different web sources with the same schema.

## Overview

This guide covers how to extract data from a list of URLs using the [Diffbot Extract API](https://www.diffbot.com/products/extract/) into structured JSON that we can use downstream.

## Setting up

Start by installing the required packages.

```python
pip install -qU langchain-community
```

Diffbot's Extract API requires an API token. Follow these instructions to [get a free API token](/oss/python/integrations/providers/diffbot#installation-and-setup) and then set an environment variable.

```python
%env DIFFBOT_API_TOKEN REPLACE_WITH_YOUR_TOKEN
```

## Using the Document Loader

Import the DiffbotLoader module and instantiate it with a list of URLs and your Diffbot token.

```python
import os

from langchain_community.document_loaders import DiffbotLoader

urls = [
    "https://python.langchain.com/",
]

loader = DiffbotLoader(urls=urls, api_token=os.environ.get("DIFFBOT_API_TOKEN"))
```

With the `.load()` method, you can see the documents loaded

```python
loader.load()
```

## Transform Extracted Text to a Graph Document

Structured page content can be further processed with `DiffbotGraphTransformer` to extract entities and relationships into a graph.

```python
pip install -qU langchain-experimental
```

```python
from langchain_experimental.graph_transformers.diffbot import DiffbotGraphTransformer

diffbot_nlp = DiffbotGraphTransformer(
    diffbot_api_key=os.environ.get("DIFFBOT_API_TOKEN")
)
graph_documents = diffbot_nlp.convert_to_graph_documents(loader.load())
```

To continue loading the data into a Knowledge Graph, follow the [`DiffbotGraphTransformer` guide](/oss/python/integrations/graphs/diffbot/#loading-the-data-into-a-knowledge-graph).
