Loader for Youtube leveraging the `yt-dlp` library.

This package implements a [document loader](/oss/python/integrations/document_loaders/) for Youtube. In contrast to the [YoutubeLoader](https://python.langchain.com/api_reference/community/document_loaders/langchain_community.document_loaders.youtube.YoutubeLoader.html) of `langchain-community`, which relies on `pytube`, `YoutubeLoaderDL` is able to fetch YouTube metadata. `langchain-yt-dlp` leverages the robust `yt-dlp` library, providing a more reliable and feature-rich YouTube document loader.
