title: Modal
---

The [Modal cloud platform](https://modal.com/docs/guide) provides convenient, on-demand access to serverless cloud compute from Python scripts on your local computer.
Use `modal` to run your own custom LLM models instead of depending on LLM APIs.

This example goes over how to use LangChain to interact with a `modal` HTTPS [web endpoint](https://modal.com/docs/guide/webhooks).

[_Question-answering with LangChain_](https://modal.com/docs/guide/ex/potus_speech_qanda) is another example of how to use LangChain alonside `Modal`. In that example, Modal runs the LangChain application end-to-end and uses OpenAI as its LLM API.

```python
pip install -qU  modal
```

```python
# Register an account with Modal and get a new token.

!modal token new
```

```output
Launching login page in your browser window...
If this is not showing up, please copy this URL into your web browser manually:
https://modal.com/token-flow/tf-Dzm3Y01234mqmm1234Vcu3
```

The [`langchain.llms.modal.Modal`](https://github.com/langchain-ai/langchain/blame/master/langchain/llms/modal.py) integration class requires that you deploy a Modal application with a web endpoint that complies with the following JSON interface:

1. The LLM prompt is accepted as a `str` value under the key `"prompt"`
2. The LLM response returned as a `str` value under the key `"prompt"`

**Example request JSON:**

```json
{
    "prompt": "Identify yourself, bot!",
    "extra": "args are allowed",
}
```

**Example response JSON:**

```json
{
    "prompt": "This is the LLM speaking",
}
```

An example 'dummy' Modal web endpoint function fulfilling this interface would be

```python
...
...

class Request(BaseModel):
    prompt: str

@stub.function()
@modal.web_endpoint(method="POST")
def web(request: Request):
    _ = request  # ignore input
    return {"prompt": "hello world"}
```

* See Modal's [web endpoints](https://modal.com/docs/guide/webhooks#passing-arguments-to-web-endpoints) guide for the basics of setting up an endpoint that fulfils this interface.
* See Modal's ['Run Falcon-40B with AutoGPTQ'](https://modal.com/docs/guide/ex/falcon_gptq) open-source LLM example as a starting point for your custom LLM!

Once you have a deployed Modal web endpoint, you can pass its URL into the `langchain.llms.modal.Modal` LLM class. This class can then function as a building block in your chain.

```python
from langchain.chains import LLMChain
from langchain_community.llms import Modal
from langchain_core.prompts import PromptTemplate
```

```python
template = """Question: {question}

Answer: Let's think step by step."""

prompt = PromptTemplate.from_template(template)
```

```python
endpoint_url = "https://ecorp--custom-llm-endpoint.modal.run"  # REPLACE ME with your deployed Modal web endpoint's URL
llm = Modal(endpoint_url=endpoint_url)
```

```python
llm_chain = LLMChain(prompt=prompt, llm=llm)
```

```python
question = "What NFL team won the Super Bowl in the year Justin Beiber was born?"

llm_chain.run(question)
```
