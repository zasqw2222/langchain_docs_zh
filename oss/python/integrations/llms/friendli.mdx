title: Friendli
---


> [Friendli](https://friendli.ai/) enhances AI application performance and optimizes cost savings with scalable, efficient deployment options, tailored for high-demand AI workloads.

This tutorial guides you through integrating `Friendli` with LangChain.

## Setup

Ensure the `langchain_community` and `friendli-client` are installed.

```sh
pip install -U langchain-community friendli-client
```

Sign in to [Friendli Suite](https://suite.friendli.ai/) to create a Personal Access Token, and set it as the `FRIENDLI_TOKEN` environment.

```python
import getpass
import os

if "FRIENDLI_TOKEN" not in os.environ:
    os.environ["FRIENDLI_TOKEN"] = getpass.getpass("Friendi Personal Access Token: ")
```

You can initialize a Friendli chat model with selecting the model you want to use.
The default model is `meta-llama-3.1-8b-instruct`. You can check the available models at [friendli.ai/docs](https://friendli.ai/docs/guides/serverless_endpoints/pricing#text-generation-models).

```python
from langchain_community.llms.friendli import Friendli

llm = Friendli(model="meta-llama-3.1-8b-instruct", max_tokens=100, temperature=0)
```

## Usage

`Frienli` supports all methods of [`LLM`](/oss/python/langchain/models) including async APIs.

You can use functionality of `invoke`, `batch`, `generate`, and `stream`.

```python
llm.invoke("Tell me a joke.")
```

```output
" I need a laugh.\nHere's one: Why couldn't the bicycle stand up by itself?\nBecause it was two-tired!\nI hope that made you laugh! Do you want to hear another one? I have a million of 'em! (Okay, maybe not a million, but I have a few more where that came from!) What kind of joke are you in the mood for? A pun, a play on words, or something else? Let me know and I'll try to come"
```

```python
llm.batch(["Tell me a joke.", "Tell me a joke."])
```

```output
[" I need a laugh.\nHere's one: Why couldn't the bicycle stand up by itself?\nBecause it was two-tired!\nI hope that made you laugh! Do you want to hear another one? I have a million of 'em! (Okay, maybe not a million, but I have a few more where that came from!) What kind of joke are you in the mood for? A pun, a play on words, or something else? Let me know and I'll try to come",
 " I need a laugh.\nHere's one: Why couldn't the bicycle stand up by itself?\nBecause it was two-tired!\nI hope that made you laugh! Do you want to hear another one? I have a million of 'em! (Okay, maybe not a million, but I have a few more where that came from!) What kind of joke are you in the mood for? A pun, a play on words, or something else? Let me know and I'll try to come"]
```

```python
llm.generate(["Tell me a joke.", "Tell me a joke."])
```

```output
LLMResult(generations=[[Generation(text=" I need a laugh.\nHere's one: Why couldn't the bicycle stand up by itself?\nBecause it was two-tired!\nI hope that made you laugh! Do you want to hear another one? I have a million of 'em! (Okay, maybe not a million, but I have a few more where that came from!) What kind of joke are you in the mood for?

Do you want to hear another one? I have a million of 'em! (Okay, maybe not a million, but I have a few more where that came from!) What kind of joke are you in the mood for?

Let me know and I'll try to come")]], llm_output={'model': 'meta-llama-3.1-8b-instruct'}, run=[RunInfo(run_id=UUID('ee97984b-6eab-4d40-a56f-51d6114953de')), RunInfo(run_id=UUID('cbe501ea-a20f-4420-9301-86cdfcf898c0'))], type='LLMResult')
```

```python
for chunk in llm.stream("Tell me a joke."):
    print(chunk, end="", flush=True)
```

You can also use all functionality of async APIs: `ainvoke`, `abatch`, `agenerate`, and `astream`.

```python
await llm.ainvoke("Tell me a joke.")
```

```output
" I need a laugh.\nHere's one: Why couldn't the bicycle stand up by itself?\nBecause it was two-tired!\nI hope that made you laugh! Do you want to hear another one? I have a million of 'em! (Okay, maybe not a million, but I have a few more where that came from!) What kind of joke are you in the mood for? A pun, a play on words, or something else? Let me know and I'll try to come"
```

```python
await llm.abatch(["Tell me a joke.", "Tell me a joke."])
```

```output
[" I need a laugh.\nHere's one: Why couldn't the bicycle stand up by itself?\nBecause it was two-tired!\nI hope that made you laugh! Do you want to hear another one? I have a million of 'em! (Okay, maybe not a million, but I have a few more where that came from!) What kind of joke are you in the mood for? A pun, a play on words, or something else? Let me know and I'll try to come",
 " I need a laugh.\nHere's one: Why couldn't the bicycle stand up by itself?\nBecause it was two-tired!\nI hope that made you laugh! Do you want to hear another one? I have a million of 'em!

```

```python
await llm.agenerate(["Tell me a joke.", "Tell me a joke."])
```

```output
LLMResult(generations=[[Generation(text=" I need a laugh.\nHere's one: Why couldn't the bicycle stand up by itself?\nBecause it was two-tired!\nI hope that made you laugh!

```

```python

    print(chunk, end="", flush=True)
