title: Llamafile
---

[Llamafile](https://github.com/Mozilla-Ocho/llamafile) lets you distribute and run LLMs with a single file.

Llamafile does this by combining [llama.cpp](https://github.com/ggerganov/llama.cpp) with [Cosmopolitan Libc](https://github.com/jart/cosmopolitan) into one framework that collapses all the complexity of LLMs down to a single-file executable (called a "llamafile") that runs locally on most computers, with no installation.

## Setup

1. Download a llamafile for the model you'd like to use. You can find many models in llamafile format on [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/models?other=llamafile). In this guide, we will download a small one, `TinyLlama-1.1B-Chat-v1.0.Q5_K_M`. Note: if you don't have `wget`, you can just download the model via this [link](https://huggingface.co/jartine/TinyLlama-1.1B-Chat-v1.0-GGUF/resolve/main/TinyLlama-1.1B-Chat-v1.0.Q5_K_M.llamafile?download=true).

```bash
wget https://huggingface.co/jartine/TinyLlama-1.1B-Chat-v1.0-GGUF/resolve/main/TinyLlama-1.1B-Chat-v1.0.Q5_K_M.llamafile
```

2. Make the llamafile executable. First, if you haven't done so already, open a terminal. **If you're using MacOS, Linux, or BSD,** you'll need to grant permission for your computer to execute this new file using `chmod` (see below). **If you're on Windows,** rename the file by adding ".exe" to the end (model file should be named `TinyLlama-1.1B-Chat-v1.0.Q5_K_M.llamafile.exe`).

```bash
chmod +x TinyLlama-1.1B-Chat-v1.0.Q5_K_M.llamafile  # run if you're on MacOS, Linux, or BSD
```

3. Run the llamafile in "server mode":

```bash
./TinyLlama-1.1B-Chat-v1.0.Q5_K_M.llamafile --server --nobrowser
```

Now you can make calls to the llamafile's REST API. By default, the llamafile server listens at [localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080). You can find full server documentation [here](https://github.com/Mozilla-Ocho/llamafile/blob/main/llama.cpp/server/README.md#api-endpoints). You can interact with the llamafile directly via the REST API, but here we'll show how to interact with it using LangChain.

## Usage

```python
from langchain_community.llms.llamafile import Llamafile

llm = Llamafile()

llm.invoke("Tell me a joke")
```

```output
'? \nI\'ve got a thing for pink, but you know that.\n"Can we not talk about work anymore?" - What did she say?\nI don\'t want to be a burden on you.\nIt\'s hard to keep a good thing going.\nYou can\'t tell me what I want, I have a life too!'
```

To stream tokens, use the `.stream(...)` method:

```python
query = "Tell me a joke"

for chunks in llm.stream(query):
    print(chunks, end="")

print()
```

```output
.
- She said, "I’m tired of my life. What should I do?"
- The man replied, "I hear you. But don’t worry. Life is just like a joke. It has its funny parts too."
- The woman looked at him, amazed and happy to hear his wise words. - "Thank you for your wisdom," she said, smiling. - He replied, "Any time. But it doesn't come easy. You have to laugh and keep moving forward in life."
- She nodded, thanking him again. - The man smiled wryly. "Life can be tough. Sometimes it seems like you’re never going to get out of your situation."
- He said, "I know that. But the key is not giving up. Life has many ups and downs, but in the end, it will turn out okay."
- The woman's eyes softened. "Thank you for your advice. It's so important to keep moving forward in life," she said. - He nodded once again. "You’re welcome. I hope your journey is filled with laughter and joy."
- They both smiled and left the bar, ready to embark on their respective adventures.
```
