Baidu AI Cloud Qianfan Platform is a one-stop large model development and service operation platform for enterprise developers. Qianfan not only provides including the model of Wenxin Yiyan (ERNIE-Bot) and the third-party open-source models, but also provides various AI development tools and the whole set of development environment, which facilitates customers to use and develop large model applications easily.

Basically, those model are split into the following type:

- Embedding
- Chat
- Completion

In this notebook, we will introduce how to use langchain with [Qianfan](https://cloud.baidu.com/doc/WENXINWORKSHOP/index.html) mainly in `Completion` corresponding
 to the package `langchain/llms` in langchain:

## API Initialization

To use the LLM services based on Baidu Qianfan, you have to initialize these parameters:

You could either choose to init the AK,SK in environment variables or init params:

```base
export QIANFAN_AK=XXX
export QIANFAN_SK=XXX
```

## Current supported models

- ERNIE-Bot-turbo (default models)
- ERNIE-Bot
- BLOOMZ-7B
- Llama-2-7b-chat
- Llama-2-13b-chat
- Llama-2-70b-chat
- Qianfan-BLOOMZ-7B-compressed
- Qianfan-Chinese-Llama-2-7B
- ChatGLM2-6B-32K
- AquilaChat-7B

```python
##Installing the langchain packages needed to use the integration
pip install -qU langchain-community
```

```python
"""For basic init and call"""
import os

from langchain_community.llms import QianfanLLMEndpoint

os.environ["QIANFAN_AK"] = "your_ak"
os.environ["QIANFAN_SK"] = "your_sk"

llm = QianfanLLMEndpoint(streaming=True)
res = llm.invoke("hi")
print(res)
```

    print(resp)

As an AI language model
, I cannot provide any inappropriate content. My goal is to provide useful and positive information to help people solve problems.
Mountains are the symbols
 of majesty and power in nature, and also the lungs of the world. They not only provide oxygen for human beings, but also provide us with beautiful scenery and refreshing air. We can climb mountains to experience the charm of nature,
 but also exercise our body and spirit. When we are not satisfied with the rote, we can go climbing, refresh our energy, and reset our focus. However, climbing mountains should be carried out in an organized and safe manner. If you don
't know how to climb, you should learn first, or seek help from professionals. Enjoy the beautiful scenery of mountains, but also pay attention to safety.
```

## Use different models in Qianfan

In the case you want to deploy your own model based on EB or serval open sources model, you could follow these steps:

- 1. （Optional, if the model are included in the default models, skip it）Deploy your model in Qianfan Console, get your own customized deploy endpoint.
- 2. Set up the field called `endpoint` in the initialization:

```python
llm = QianfanLLMEndpoint(
    streaming=True,
    model="ERNIE-Bot-turbo",
    endpoint="eb-instant",
)
res = llm.invoke("hi")
```

```output
[INFO] [09-15 20:23:36] logging.py:55 [t:140708023539520]: requesting llm api endpoint: /chat/eb-instant
```

## Model Params

For now, only `ERNIE-Bot` and `ERNIE-Bot-turbo` support model params below, we might support more models in the future.

- temperature
- top_p
- penalty_score

```python
res = llm.generate(
    prompts=["hi"],
    streaming=True,
    **{"top_p": 0.4, "temperature": 0.1, "penalty_score": 1},
)

for r in res:
    print(r)
```

```output
[INFO] [09-15 20:23:40] logging.py:55 [t:140708023539520]: requesting llm api endpoint: /chat/eb-instant
```
```output
('generations', [[Generation(text='您好，您似乎输入了一个文本字符串，但并没有给出具体的问题或场景。如果您能提供更多信息，我可以更好地回答您的问题。', generation_info=None)]])
('llm_output', None)
('run', [RunInfo(run_id=UUID('9d0bfb14-cf15-44a9-bca1-b3e96b75befe'))])
```
