This will help you get started with Pipeshift completion models (LLMs) using LangChain. For detailed documentation on `Pipeshift` features and configuration options, please refer to the [API reference](https://dashboard.pipeshift.com/docs).

## Overview

### Integration details

| Class | Package | Local | Serializable | [JS support](https://js.langchain.com/docs/integrations/llms/pipeshift) | Downloads | Version |
| :--- | :--- | :---: | :---: |  :---: | :---: | :---: |
| [Pipeshift](https://dashboard.pipeshift.com/docs) | [langchain-pipeshift](https://pypi.org/project/langchain-pipeshift/) | ❌ | - | ❌ | ![PyPI - Downloads](https://img.shields.io/pypi/dm/langchain-pipeshift?style=flat-square&label=%20) | ![PyPI - Version](https://img.shields.io/pypi/v/langchain-pipeshift?style=flat-square&label=%20) |

## Setup

To access Pipeshift models you'll need to create a Pipeshift account, get an API key, and install the `langchain-pipeshift` integration package.

### Credentials

Head to [Pipeshift](https://dashboard.pipeshift.com) to sign up to Pipeshift and generate an API key. Once you've done this set the PIPESHIFT_API_KEY environment variable:

```python
import getpass
import os

if not os.getenv("PIPESHIFT_API_KEY"):
    os.environ["PIPESHIFT_API_KEY"] = getpass.getpass("Enter your Pipeshift API key: ")
```

If you want to get automated tracing of your model calls you can also set your [LangSmith](https://docs.smith.langchain.com/) API key by uncommenting below:

```python
os.environ["LANGSMITH_TRACING"] = "true"
os.environ["LANGSMITH_API_KEY"] = getpass.getpass("Enter your LangSmith API key: ")
```

### Installation

The LangChain Pipeshift integration lives in the `langchain-pipeshift` package:

```python
pip install -qU langchain-pipeshift
```

```output
Note: you may need to restart the kernel to use updated packages.
```

## Instantiation

Now we can instantiate our model object and generate chat completions:

```python
from langchain_pipeshift import Pipeshift

llm = Pipeshift(
    model="meta-llama/Meta-Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct",
    temperature=0,
    max_tokens=512,
)
```

## Invocation

```python
input_text = "Pipeshift is an AI company that "

completion = llm.invoke(input_text)
completion
```

```output
