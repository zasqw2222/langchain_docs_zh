title: "WRITER text splitters"
---

This guide provides a quick overview for getting started with WRITER's [text splitter](/oss/python/integrations/splitters/).

WRITER's [context-aware splitting endpoint](https://dev.writer.com/api-guides/tools#context-aware-text-splitting) provides intelligent text splitting capabilities for long documents (up to 4000 words). Unlike simple character-based splitting, it preserves the semantic meaning and context between chunks, making it ideal for processing long-form content while maintaining coherence. In `langchain-writer`, we provide usage of WRITER's context-aware splitting endpoint as a LangChain text splitter.

## Setup

The `WriterTextSplitter` is available in the `langchain-writer` package:

```python
pip install --quiet -U langchain-writer
```

### Credentials

Sign up for [WRITER AI Studio](https://app.writer.com/aistudio/signup?utm_campaign=devrel) to generate an API key (you can follow this [Quickstart](https://dev.writer.com/api-guides/quickstart)). Then, set the WRITER_API_KEY environment variable:

```python
import getpass
import os

if not os.getenv("WRITER_API_KEY"):
    os.environ["WRITER_API_KEY"] = getpass.getpass("Enter your WRITER API key: ")
```

It's also helpful (but not needed) to set up [LangSmith](https://smith.langchain.com/) for best-in-class observability. If you wish to do so, you can set the `LANGSMITH_TRACING` and `LANGSMITH_API_KEY` environment variables:

```python
os.environ["LANGSMITH_TRACING"] = "true"
# os.environ["LANGSMITH_API_KEY"] = getpass.getpass()
```

### Instantiation

Instantiate an instance of `WriterTextSplitter` with the `strategy` parameter set to one of the following:

- `llm_split`: Uses language model for precise semantic splitting
- `fast_split`: Uses heuristic-based approach for quick splitting
- `hybrid_split`: Combines both approaches

```python
from langchain_writer.text_splitter import WriterTextSplitter

splitter = WriterTextSplitter(strategy="fast_split")
```

## Usage

The `WriterTextSplitter` can be used synchronously or asynchronously.

### Synchronous usage

To use the `WriterTextSplitter` synchronously, call the `split_text` method with the text you want to split:

```python
text = """Reeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeaally long text you want to divide into smaller chunks. For example you can add a poem multiple times:
Two roads diverged in a yellow wood,
And sorry I could not travel both
And be one traveler, long I stood
And looked down one as far as I could
To where it bent in the undergrowth;

Then took the other, as just as fair,
And having perhaps the better claim,
Because it was grassy and wanted wear;
Though as for that the passing there
Had worn them really about the same,

And both that morning equally lay
In leaves no step had trodden black.
Oh, I kept the first for another day!
Yet knowing how way leads on to way,
I doubted if I should ever come back.

I shall be telling this with a sigh
Somewhere ages and ages hence:
Two roads diverged in a wood, and I—
I took the one less traveled by,
And that has made all the difference.

"""

chunks = splitter.split_text(text)
chunks
```

You can print the length of the chunks to see how many chunks were created:

```python
print(len(chunks))
```

### Asynchronous usage

To use the `WriterTextSplitter` asynchronously, call the `asplit_text` method with the text you want to split:

```python
async_chunks = await splitter.asplit_text(text)
async_chunks
```

Print the length of the chunks to see how many chunks were created:

```python
print(len(async_chunks))
```
