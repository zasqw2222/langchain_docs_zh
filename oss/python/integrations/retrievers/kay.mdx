>[Kai Data API](https://www.kay.ai/) built for RAG 🕵️ We are curating the world's largest datasets as high-quality embeddings so your AI agents can retrieve context on the fly. Latest models, fast retrieval, and zero infra.

This notebook shows you how to retrieve datasets supported by [Kay](https://kay.ai/). You can currently search `SEC Filings` and `Press Releases of US companies`. Visit [kay.ai](https://kay.ai) for the latest data drops. For any questions, join our [discord](https://discord.gg/hAnE4e5T6M) or [tweet at us](https://twitter.com/vishalrohra_)

## Installation

First, install the [`kay` package](https://pypi.org/project/kay/).

```python
!pip install kay
```

You will also need an API key: you can get one for free at [https://kay.ai](https://kay.ai/). Once you have an API key, you must set it as an environment variable `KAY_API_KEY`.

`KayAiRetriever` has a static `.create()` factory method that takes the following arguments:

* `dataset_id: string` required -- A Kay dataset id. This is a collection of data about a particular entity such as companies, people, or places. For example, try `"company"`
* `data_type: List[string]` optional -- This is a category within a  dataset based on its origin or format, such as ‘SEC Filings’, ‘Press Releases’, or ‘Reports’ within the “company” dataset. For example, try ["10-K", "10-Q", "PressRelease"] under the “company” dataset. If left empty, Kay will retrieve the most relevant context across all types.
* `num_contexts: int` optional, defaults to 6 -- The number of document chunks to retrieve on each call to `get_relevant_documents()`

## Examples

### Basic Retriever Usage

# Setup API key

-> **Question**: What were the biggest strategy changes and partnerships made by Roku in 2023?

**Answer**: In 2023, Roku made a strategic partnership with FreeWheel to bring Roku's leading ad tech to FreeWheel customers. This partnership aimed to drive greater interoperability and automation in the advertising-based video on demand (AVOD) space. Key highlights of this collaboration include streamlined integration of Roku's demand application programming interface (dAPI) with FreeWheel's TV platform, allowing for better inventory quality control and improved publisher yield and revenue. Additionally, publishers can now use Roku platform signals to enable advertisers to target audiences and measure campaign performance without relying on cookies. This partnership also involves the use of data clean room technology to enable the activation of additional data sets for better measurement and monetization for publishers and agencies. These partnerships and strategies aim to support Roku's growth in the AVOD market.
