title: Cohere RAG
---

>[Cohere](https://cohere.ai/about) is a Canadian startup that provides natural language processing models that help companies improve human-machine interactions.

This notebook covers how to get started with the `Cohere RAG` retriever. This allows you to leverage the ability to search documents over various connectors or by supplying your own.

```python
import getpass
import os

os.environ["COHERE_API_KEY"] = getpass.getpass()

```python
from langchain_cohere import ChatCohere, CohereRagRetriever
from langchain_core.documents import Document
```

```python
rag = CohereRagRetriever(llm=ChatCohere())
```

```python
def _pretty_print(docs):
    for doc in docs:
        print(doc.metadata)
        print("\n\n" + doc.page_content)
        print("\n\n" + "-" * 30 + "\n\n")
```

```python

In a sign that there’s plenty of cash to go around for generative AI startups, Cohere, which is developing an AI model ecosystem for the enterprise, today announced that it raised $270 million as part of its Series C round.

Reuters reported earlier in the year that Cohere was in talks to raise “hundreds of millions” of dollars at a valuation of upward of just over $6 billion. If there’s credence to that reporting, Cohere appears to have missed the valuation mark substantially; a source familiar with the matter tells TechCrunch that this tranche values the company at between $2.1 billion and $2.2 billion.
