## Retriever Example

This notebook demonstrates how to search historical chat message histories using the [Zep Long-term Memory Store](https://www.getzep.com/).

We'll demonstrate:

1. Adding conversation history to the Zep memory store.
2. Vector search over the conversation history:
    1. With a similarity search over chat messages
    2. Using maximal marginal relevance re-ranking of a chat message search
    3. Filtering a search using metadata filters
    4. A similarity search over summaries of the chat messages
    5. Using maximal marginal relevance re-ranking of a summary search

```python
import getpass
import time
from uuid import uuid4

from langchain_community.memory.zep_cloud_memory import ZepCloudMemory
from langchain_community.retrievers import ZepCloudRetriever
from langchain.messages import AIMessage, HumanMessage

# Provide your Zep API key.
zep_api_key = getpass.getpass()
```

### Initialize the Zep Chat Message History Class and add a chat message history to the memory store

**NOTE:** Unlike other Retrievers, the content returned by the Zep Retriever is session/user specific. A `session_id` is required when instantiating the Retriever.

```python
session_id = str(uuid4())  # This is a unique identifier for the user/session

# Initialize the Zep Memory Class
zep_memory = ZepCloudMemory(session_id=session_id, api_key=zep_api_key)
```

```python
# Preload some messages into the memory. The default message window is 4 messages. We want to push beyond this to demonstrate auto-summarization.
test_history = [

]

for msg in test_history:
    zep_memory.chat_memory.add_message(
        HumanMessage(content=msg["content"])
        if msg["role"] == "human"
        else AIMessage(content=msg["content"])
    )

time.sleep(
    10
)  # Wait for the messages to be embedded and summarized, this happens asynchronously.
```

### Use the Zep Retriever to vector search over the Zep memory

Zep provides native vector search over historical conversation memory. Embedding happens automatically.

NOTE: Embedding of messages occurs asynchronously, so the first query may not return results. Subsequent queries will return results as the embeddings are generated.

```python
zep_retriever = ZepCloudRetriever(
    api_key=zep_api_key,
    session_id=session_id,  # Ensure that you provide the session_id when instantiating the Retriever
    top_k=5,
)

await zep_retriever.ainvoke("Who wrote Parable of the Sower?")
```

```output
[Document(page_content="What is the 'Parable of the Sower'?", metadata={'score': 0.9333381652832031, 'uuid': 'bebc441c-a32d-44a1-ae61-968e7b3d4956', 'created_at': '2024-05-10T05:02:01.857627Z', 'token_count': 11, 'role': 'human'}),

```

We can also use the Zep sync API to retrieve results:

```python
zep_retriever.invoke("Who wrote Parable of the Sower?")
```

```output
[Document(page_content='Parable of the Sower is a science fiction novel by Octavia Butler set in a dystopian future in the 2020s. The story follows Lauren Olamina, a young woman living in a society that has collapsed due to environmental disasters, poverty, and violence. The novel explores themes of societal breakdown, the struggle for survival, and the search for a better future.', metadata={'score': 0.8473024368286133, 'uuid': 'e4689f8e-33be-4a59-a9c2-e5ef5dd70f74', 'created_at': '2024-05-10T05:02:02.713123Z', 'token_count': 76})]
```

### Reranking using MMR (Maximal Marginal Relevance)

Zep has native, SIMD-accelerated support for reranking results using MMR. This is useful for removing redundancy in results.

```python
zep_retriever = ZepCloudRetriever(
    api_key=zep_api_key,
    session_id=session_id,  # Ensure that you provide the session_id when instantiating the Retriever
    top_k=5,
    search_type="mmr",
    mmr_lambda=0.5,
)

await zep_retriever.ainvoke("Who wrote Parable of the Sower?")
```

### Using metadata filters to refine search results

Zep supports filtering results by metadata. This is useful for filtering results by entity type, or other metadata.

More information here: [help.getzep.com/document-collections#searching-a-collection-with-hybrid-vector-search](https://help.getzep.com/document-collections#searching-a-collection-with-hybrid-vector-search)

```python
filter = {"where": {"jsonpath": '$[*] ? (@.baz == "qux")'}}

await zep_retriever.ainvoke(
    "Who wrote Parable of the Sower?", config={"metadata": filter}
)
```

### Searching over Summaries with MMR Reranking

Zep automatically generates summaries of chat messages. These summaries can be searched over using the Zep Retriever. Since a summary is a distillation of a conversation, they're more likely to match your search query and offer rich, succinct context to the LLM.

Successive summaries may include similar content, with Zep's similarity search returning the highest matching results but with little diversity.
MMR re-ranks the results to ensure that the summaries you populate into your prompt are both relevant and each offers additional information to the LLM.

```python
zep_retriever = ZepCloudRetriever(
    api_key=zep_api_key,
    session_id=session_id,  # Ensure that you provide the session_id when instantiating the Retriever
    top_k=3,
    search_scope="summary",
    search_type="mmr",
    mmr_lambda=0.5,
)

await zep_retriever.ainvoke("Who wrote Parable of the Sower?")
```

```output
