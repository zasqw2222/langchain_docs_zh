title: Llamafile
---

>[llamafile](https://github.com/Mozilla-Ocho/llamafile) lets you distribute and run LLMs
> with a single file.

>`llamafile` makes open LLMs much more accessible to both developers and end users.
> `llamafile` is doing that by combining [llama.cpp](https://github.com/ggerganov/llama.cpp) with
> [Cosmopolitan Libc](https://github.com/jart/cosmopolitan) into one framework that collapses
> all the complexity of LLMs down to a single-file executable (called a "llamafile")
> that runs locally on most computers, with no installation.
