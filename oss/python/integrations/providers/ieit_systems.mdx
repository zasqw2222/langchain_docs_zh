```python
from langchain_community.llms.yuan2 import Yuan2
```

## Chat models

See the [installation instructions](/oss/python/integrations/chat/yuan2/#setting-up-your-api-server).

Yuan2.0 provided an OpenAI compatible API, and ChatYuan2 is integrated into langchain by using `OpenAI client`.
Therefore, ensure the `openai` package is installed.

<CodeGroup>
```bash pip
pip install openai
```

```bash uv
uv add openai
```
</CodeGroup>
