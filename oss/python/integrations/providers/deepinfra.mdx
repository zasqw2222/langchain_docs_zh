title: DeepInfra
---

>[DeepInfra](https://deepinfra.com/docs) allows us to run the
> [latest machine learning models](https://deepinfra.com/models) with ease.
> DeepInfra takes care of all the heavy lifting related to running, scaling and monitoring
> the models. Users can focus on your application and integrate the models with simple REST API calls.

>DeepInfra provides [examples](https://deepinfra.com/docs/advanced/langchain) of integration with LangChain.

This page covers how to use the `DeepInfra` ecosystem within `LangChain`.
It is broken into two parts: installation and setup, and then references to specific DeepInfra wrappers.

## Installation and Setup

- Get your DeepInfra api key from this link [here](https://deepinfra.com/).
- Get an DeepInfra api key and set it as an environment variable (`DEEPINFRA_API_TOKEN`)

## Available Models

DeepInfra provides a range of Open Source LLMs ready for deployment.

You can see supported models for
[text-generation](https://deepinfra.com/models?type=text-generation) and
[embeddings](https://deepinfra.com/models?type=embeddings).

You can view a [list of request and response parameters](https://deepinfra.com/meta-llama/Llama-2-70b-chat-hf/api).

Chat models [follow openai api](https://deepinfra.com/meta-llama/Llama-2-70b-chat-hf/api?example=openai-http)


## LLM

```python
from langchain_community.embeddings import DeepInfraEmbeddings
```

## Chat Models

See a [usage example](/oss/python/integrations/chat/deepinfra).
