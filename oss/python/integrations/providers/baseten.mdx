title: Baseten
---

>[Baseten](https://baseten.co) is a provider of all the infrastructure you need to deploy and serve
> ML models performantly, reliably, and scalably.

>As a model inference platform, `Baseten` is a `Provider` in the LangChain ecosystem.
The `Baseten` integration currently implements `Chat Models` and `Embeddings` components.

>`Baseten` lets you access both open source models like Kimi K2 or GPT OSS on model APIs by specifying a `model` [slug](https://docs.baseten.co/development/model-apis/overview#supported-models) and run proprietary or
fine-tuned models on dedicated GPUs through dedicated deployments by specifying a `model_url`.

## Installation and Setup

You'll need two things to use Baseten models with LangChain:

* A [Baseten account](https://baseten.co)
* An [API key](https://docs.baseten.co/observability/api-keys)

Export your API key to your as an environment variable called `BASETEN_API_KEY`.

```sh
export BASETEN_API_KEY="paste_your_api_key_here"
```

## Chat Models (Model APIs and Dedicated Deployments)

See a [usage example](/oss/python/integrations/chat/baseten).

```python
from langchain_baseten import ChatBaseten
```

## Embeddings (Dedicated Deployments Only)

See a [usage example](/oss/python/integrations/text_embedding/baseten).

```python
from langchain_baseten import BasetenEmbeddings
```
