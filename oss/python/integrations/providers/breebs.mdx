title: Breebs (Open Knowledge)
---

>[Breebs](https://www.breebs.com/) is an open collaborative knowledge platform.
>Anybody can create a `Breeb`, a knowledge capsule based on PDFs stored on a Google Drive folder.
>A `Breeb` can be used by any LLM/chatbot to improve its expertise, reduce hallucinations and give access to sources.
>Behind the scenes, `Breebs` implements several `Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG)` models
> to seamlessly provide useful context at each iteration.

## Retriever

```python
from langchain_classic.retrievers import BreebsRetriever
