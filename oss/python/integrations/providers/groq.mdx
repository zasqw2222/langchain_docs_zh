<Warning>
    This page makes reference to [Groq](https://console.groq.com/docs/overview), an AI hardware and software company. For information on how to use Grok models (provided by [xAI](https://docs.x.ai/docs/overview)), see the [xAI provider page](/oss/python/python/integrations/providers/xai).
</Warning>

>[Groq](https://groq.com) developed the world's first Language Processing Unit™, or `LPU`.
> The `Groq LPU` has a deterministic, single core streaming architecture that sets the standard
> for GenAI inference speed with predictable and repeatable performance for any given workload.
>
>Beyond the architecture, `Groq` software is designed to empower developers like you with
> the tools you need to create innovative, powerful AI applications.
>
>With Groq as your engine, you can:
>* Achieve uncompromised low latency and performance for real-time AI and HPC inferences
>* Know the exact performance and compute time for any given workload
>* Take advantage of our cutting-edge technology to stay ahead of the competition
