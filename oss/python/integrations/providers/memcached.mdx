title: Memcached
---

> [Memcached](https://www.memcached.org/) is a free & open source, high-performance, distributed memory object caching system,
> generic in nature, but intended for use in speeding up dynamic web applications by alleviating database load.

This page covers how to use Memcached with langchain, using [pymemcache](https://github.com/pinterest/pymemcache) as
a client to connect to an already running Memcached instance.

## Installation and Setup

<CodeGroup>
```bash pip
pip install pymemcache
```

```bash uv
uv add pymemcache
```
</CodeGroup>

## LLM Cache

To integrate a Memcached Cache into your application:
```python3
from langchain.globals import set_llm_cache
from langchain_openai import OpenAI

from langchain_community.cache import MemcachedCache
from pymemcache.client.base import Client

llm = OpenAI(model="gpt-3.5-turbo-instruct", n=2, best_of=2)
set_llm_cache(MemcachedCache(Client('localhost')))

# The first time, it is not yet in cache, so it should take longer
llm.invoke("Which city is the most crowded city in the USA?")

# The second time it is, so it goes faster
llm.invoke("Which city is the most crowded city in the USA?")
```
