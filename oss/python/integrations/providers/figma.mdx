>[Figma](https://www.figma.com/) is a collaborative web application for interface design.

## Installation and Setup

The Figma API requires an `access token`, `node_ids`, and a `file key`.

The `file key` can be pulled from the URL.  https://www.figma.com/file/\{filekey\}/sampleFilename

`Node IDs` are also available in the URL. Click on anything and look for the '?node-id=\{node_id\}' param.

`Access token` [instructions](https://help.figma.com/hc/en-us/articles/8085703771159-Manage-personal-access-tokens).

## Document Loader

See a [usage example](/oss/python/integrations/document_loaders/figma).

```python
from langchain_community.document_loaders import FigmaFileLoader
```
