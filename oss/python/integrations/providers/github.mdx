>[GitHub](https://github.com/) is a developer platform that allows developers to create,
> store, manage and share their code. It uses `Git` software, providing the
> distributed version control of Git plus access control, bug tracking,
> software feature requests, task management, continuous integration, and wikis for every project.


## Installation and Setup

To access the GitHub API, you need a [personal access token](https://github.com/settings/tokens).


## Document Loader

There are two document loaders available for GitHub.

See a [usage example](/oss/python/integrations/document_loaders/github).

```python
from langchain_community.document_loaders import GitHubIssuesLoader, GithubFileLoader
```

## Tools/Toolkit

### GitHubToolkit
The `GitHub` toolkit contains tools that enable an LLM agent to interact
with a GitHub repository.

The toolkit is a wrapper for the `PyGitHub` library.

```python
from langchain_community.agent_toolkits.github.toolkit import GitHubToolkit
```

Learn more in the [example notebook](/oss/python/integrations/tools/github).
