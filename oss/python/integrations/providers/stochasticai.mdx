This page covers how to use the StochasticAI ecosystem within LangChain.
It is broken into two parts: installation and setup, and then references to specific StochasticAI wrappers.

## Installation and Setup
- Install with `pip install stochasticx`
- Get an StochasticAI api key and set it as an environment variable (`STOCHASTICAI_API_KEY`)

## Wrappers

### LLM

There exists an StochasticAI LLM wrapper, which you can access with
```python
from langchain_community.llms import StochasticAI
```
