## Wrappers

### Utility

There exists a DataheraldAPIWrapper utility which wraps this API. To import this utility:

```python
from langchain_community.utilities.dataherald import DataheraldAPIWrapper
```

For a more detailed walkthrough of this wrapper, see [this notebook](/oss/python/integrations/tools/dataherald).

### Tool

You can use the tool in an agent like this:
```python
from langchain_community.utilities.dataherald import DataheraldAPIWrapper
from langchain_community.tools.dataherald.tool import DataheraldTextToSQL
from langchain_openai import ChatOpenAI
from langchain_classic import hub
from langchain.agents import AgentExecutor, create_agent, load_tools

api_wrapper = DataheraldAPIWrapper(db_connection_id="<db_connection_id>")
tool = DataheraldTextToSQL(api_wrapper=api_wrapper)
llm = ChatOpenAI(model="gpt-3.5-turbo", temperature=0)
prompt = hub.pull("hwchase17/react")
agent = create_agent(llm, tools, prompt)
agent_executor = AgentExecutor(agent=agent, tools=tools, verbose=True, handle_parsing_errors=True)
agent_executor.invoke({"input":"Return the sql for this question: How many employees are in the company?"})
```

Output
```shell
> Entering new AgentExecutor chain...
I need to use a tool that can convert this question into SQL.
Action: dataherald
Action Input: How many employees are in the company?Answer: SELECT
    COUNT(*) FROM employeesI now know the final answer
Final Answer: SELECT
    COUNT(*)
FROM
    employees

> Finished chain.
{'input': 'Return the sql for this question: How many employees are in the company?', 'output': "SELECT \n    COUNT(*)\nFROM \n    employees"}
```
