> the `Meta AI Research` team and used for
> creating multilingual sentence embeddings for
> [over 147 languages as of 2/25/2024](https://github.com/facebookresearch/flores/blob/main/flores200/README.md#languages-in-flores-200)

<CodeGroup>
```bash pip
pip install laser_encoders
```

```bash uv
uv add laser_encoders
```
</CodeGroup>

See a [usage example](/oss/python/integrations/text_embedding/laser).

```python
from langchain_community.embeddings.laser import LaserEmbeddings
```

## Document loaders

### Facebook Messenger

>[Messenger](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Messenger_(software)) is an instant messaging app and
> platform developed by `Meta Platforms`. Originally developed as `Facebook Chat` in 2008, the company revamped its

## Vector stores

### Facebook Faiss

>[Facebook AI Similarity Search (Faiss)](https://engineering.fb.com/2017/03/29/data-infrastructure/faiss-a-library-for-efficient-similarity-search/)
> is a library for efficient similarity search and clustering of dense vectors. It contains algorithms that
> search in sets of vectors of any size, up to ones that possibly do not fit in RAM. It also contains supporting
> code for evaluation and parameter tuning.

[Faiss documentation](https://faiss.ai/).

We need to install `faiss` python package.

<CodeGroup>
```bash pip
pip install faiss-gpu # For CUDA 7.5+ supported GPU's.
```

```bash uv
uv add faiss-gpu # For CUDA 7.5+ supported GPUs.
```
</CodeGroup>

OR

<CodeGroup>
```bash pip
pip install faiss-cpu # For CPU Installation
```

```bash uv
uv add faiss-cpu # For CPU Installation
```
</CodeGroup>

See a [usage example](/oss/python/integrations/vectorstores/faiss).

```python
from langchain_community.vectorstores import FAISS
```

## Chat loaders

### Facebook Messenger
