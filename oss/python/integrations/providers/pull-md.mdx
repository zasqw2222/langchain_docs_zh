title: PullMd Loader
---

>[PullMd](https://pull.md/) is a service that converts web pages into Markdown format. The `langchain-pull-md` package utilizes this service to convert URLs, especially those rendered with JavaScript frameworks like React, Angular, or Vue.js, into Markdown without the need for local rendering.

## Installation and Setup

To get started with `langchain-pull-md`, you need to install the package via pip:

<CodeGroup>
```bash pip
pip install langchain-pull-md
```

```bash uv
uv add langchain-pull-md
```
</CodeGroup>

See the [usage example](/oss/python/integrations/document_loaders/pull_md) for detailed integration and usage instructions.

## Document Loader

The `PullMdLoader` class in `langchain-pull-md` provides an easy way to convert URLs to Markdown. It's particularly useful for loading content from modern web applications for use within LangChain's processing capabilities.

```python
from langchain_pull_md import PullMdLoader

# Initialize the loader with a URL of a JavaScript-rendered webpage
loader = PullMdLoader(url='https://example.com')

# Load the content as a Document
documents = loader.load()

# Access the Markdown content
for document in documents:
    print(document.page_content)
```

This loader supports any URL and is particularly adept at handling sites built with dynamic JavaScript, making it a versatile tool for markdown extraction in data processing workflows.
