---

>[LocalAI](https://localai.io/) is the free, Open Source OpenAI alternative.
> `LocalAI` act as a drop-in replacement REST API that’s compatible with OpenAI API
> specifications for local inferencing. It allows you to run LLMs, generate images,
> audio (and not only) locally or on-prem with consumer grade hardware,
> supporting multiple model families and architectures.
