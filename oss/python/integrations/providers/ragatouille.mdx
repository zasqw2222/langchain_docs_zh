>[RAGatouille](https://github.com/bclavie/RAGatouille) makes it as simple as can be to use `ColBERT`! [ColBERT](https://github.com/stanford-futuredata/ColBERT) is a fast and accurate retrieval model, enabling scalable BERT-based search over large text collections in tens of milliseconds.

There are multiple ways that we can use RAGatouille.

## Setup

The integration lives in the `ragatouille` package.

```bash
pip install -U ragatouille
```

```python
from ragatouille import RAGPretrainedModel

RAG = RAGPretrainedModel.from_pretrained("colbert-ir/colbertv2.0")
```

```output
[Jan 10, 10:53:28] Loading segmented_maxsim_cpp extension (set COLBERT_LOAD_TORCH_EXTENSION_VERBOSE=True for more info)...
```
```output
/Users/harrisonchase/.pyenv/versions/3.10.1/envs/langchain/lib/python3.10/site-packages/torch/cuda/amp/grad_scaler.py:125: UserWarning: torch.cuda.amp.GradScaler is enabled, but CUDA is not available.  Disabling.
  warnings.warn(
```

## Retriever

We can use RAGatouille as a retriever. For more information on this, see the [RAGatouille Retriever](/oss/python/integrations/retrievers/ragatouille)

## Document Compressor

We can also use RAGatouille off-the-shelf as a reranker. This will allow us to use ColBERT to rerank retrieved results from any generic retriever. The benefits of this are that we can do this on top of any existing index, so that we don't need to create a new index.

## Setup Vanilla Retriever

First, let's set up a vanilla retriever as an example.

```python
import requests
from langchain_community.vectorstores import FAISS
from langchain_openai import OpenAIEmbeddings
from langchain_text_splitters import RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter


def get_wikipedia_page(title: str):
    """
    Retrieve the full text content of a Wikipedia page.

    :param title: str - Title of the Wikipedia page.
    :return: str - Full text content of the page as raw string.
    """
    # Wikipedia API endpoint
        URL = "https://en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php"

    # Parameters for the API request
        params = {
        "action": "query",
        "format": "json",
        "titles": title,
        "prop": "extracts",
        "explaintext": True,
    }

    # Custom User-Agent header to comply with Wikipedia's best practices
        headers = {"User-Agent": "RAGatouille_tutorial/0.0.1 (ben@clavie.eu)"}

        response = requests.get(URL, params=params, headers=headers)
        data = response.json()

    # Extracting page content
        page = next(iter(data["query"]["pages"].values()))
    return page["extract"] if "extract" in page else None


text = get_wikipedia_page("Hayao_Miyazaki")
text_splitter = RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter(chunk_size=500, chunk_overlap=0)
texts = text_splitter.create_documents([text])
```

```python
retriever = FAISS.from_documents(texts, OpenAIEmbeddings()).as_retriever(
        search_kwargs={"k": 10}
)
```

```python
docs = retriever.invoke("What animation studio did Miyazaki found")
docs[0]
```

```output
Document(page_content='collaborative projects. In April 1984, Miyazaki opened his own office in Suginami Ward, naming it Nibariki.')
```

We can see that the result isn't super relevant to the question asked

## Using ColBERT as a reranker

```python
from langchain_classic.retrievers.contextual_compression import ContextualCompressionRetriever

compression_retriever = ContextualCompressionRetriever(
        base_compressor=RAG.as_langchain_document_compressor(), base_retriever=retriever
)

compressed_docs = compression_retriever.invoke(
    "What animation studio did Miyazaki found"
)
```

```output
/Users/harrisonchase/.pyenv/versions/3.10.1/envs/langchain/lib/python3.10/site-packages/torch/amp/autocast_mode.py:250: UserWarning: User provided device_type of 'cuda', but CUDA is not available. Disabling
  warnings.warn(
```

```python
compressed_docs[0]
```

```output
Document(page_content='In June 1985, Miyazaki, Takahata, Tokuma and Suzuki founded the animation production company Studio Ghibli, with funding from Tokuma Shoten. Studio Ghibli\'s first film, Laputa: Castle in the Sky (1986), employed the same production crew of Nausicaä. Miyazaki\'s designs for the film\'s setting were inspired by Greek architecture and "European urbanistic templates". Some of the architecture in the film was also inspired by a Welsh mining town; Miyazaki witnessed the mining strike upon his first', metadata={'relevance_score': 26.5194149017334})
```

This answer is much more relevant!
