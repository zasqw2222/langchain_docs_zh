title: LLMRails
---

>[LLMRails](https://www.llmrails.com/) is a API platform for building GenAI applications. It provides an easy-to-use API for document indexing and querying that is managed by LLMRails and is optimized for performance and accuracy.
See the [LLMRails API documentation](https://docs.llmrails.com/) for more information on how to use the API.

You'll need to install `langchain-community` with `pip install -qU langchain-community` to use this integration

This notebook shows how to use functionality related to the `LLMRails`'s integration with langchain.
Note that unlike many other integrations in this category, LLMRails provides an end-to-end managed service for retrieval augmented generation, which includes:

1. A way to extract text from document files and chunk them into sentences.
2. Its own embeddings model and vector store - each text segment is encoded into a vector embedding and stored in the LLMRails internal vector store
3. A query service that automatically encodes the query into embedding, and retrieves the most relevant text segments (including support for [Hybrid Search](https://docs.llmrails.com/datastores/search))

All of these are supported in this LangChain integration.

# Setup

You will need a LLMRails account to use LLMRails with LangChain. To get started, use the following steps:

1. [Sign up](https://console.llmrails.com/signup) for a LLMRails account if you don't already have one.
2. Next you'll need to create API keys to access the API. Click on the **"API Keys"** tab in the corpus view and then the **"Create API Key"** button. Give your key a name. Click "Create key" and you now have an active API key. Keep this key confidential.

To use LangChain with LLMRails, you'll need to have this value: api_key.
You can provide those to LangChain in two ways:

1. Include in your environment these two variables: `LLM_RAILS_API_KEY`, `LLM_RAILS_DATASTORE_ID`.

> For example, you can set these variables using os.environ and getpass as follows:

```python
import os
import getpass

os.environ["LLM_RAILS_API_KEY"] = getpass.getpass("LLMRails API Key:")
os.environ["LLM_RAILS_DATASTORE_ID"] = getpass.getpass("LLMRails Datastore Id:")
```

1. Provide them as arguments when creating the LLMRails vectorstore object:

```python
vectorstore = LLMRails(
    api_key=llm_rails_api_key,
    datastore_id=datastore_id
)
```

## Adding text

For adding text to your datastore first you have to go to [Datastores](https://console.llmrails.com/datastores) page and create one. Click Create Datastore button and choose a name and embedding model for your datastore. Then get your datastore id from newly created  datastore settings.

```python
pip install tika
```

import os

from langchain_community.vectorstores import LLMRails

os.environ["LLM_RAILS_DATASTORE_ID"] = "Your datastore id "
os.environ["LLM_RAILS_API_KEY"] = "Your API Key"

llm_rails = LLMRails.from_texts(["Your text here"])
```

## Similarity search

The simplest scenario for using LLMRails is to perform a similarity search.

```python
query = "What do you plan to do about national security?"
found_docs = llm_rails.similarity_search(query, k=5)
```

```python
print(found_docs[0].page_content)
```

```output
6  N A T I O N A L S E C U R I T Y S T R A T E G Y Page 7 

This National Security Strategy lays out our plan to achieve a better future of a free, open, secure, and prosperous world.

Our strategy is rooted in our national interests: to protect the security of the American people; to expand economic prosperity and opportunity; and to realize and defend the democratic values at the heart of the American way of life.

We can do none of this alone and we do not have to.

Most nations around the world define their interests in ways that are compatible with ours.

We will build the strongest and broadest possible coalition of nations that seek to cooperate with each other, while competing with those powers that offer a darker vision and thwarting their efforts to threaten our interests.

Our Enduring Role The need for a strong and purposeful American role in the world has never been greater.

The world is becoming more divided and unstable.

Global increases in inflation since the COVID-19 pandemic began have made life more difficult for many.

The basic laws and principles governing relations among nations, including the United Nations Charter and the protection it affords all states from being invaded by their neighbors or having their borders redrawn by force, are under attack.

The risk of conflict between major powers is increasing.

Democracies and autocracies are engaged in a contest to show which system of governance can best deliver for their people and the world.

Competition to develop and deploy foundational technologies that will transform our security and economy is intensifying.

Global cooperation on shared interests has frayed, even as the need for that cooperation takes on existential importance.

The scale of these changes grows with each passing year, as do the risks of inaction.

Although the international environment has become more contested, the United States remains the world’s leading power.

## Similarity search with score

Sometimes we might want to perform the search, but also obtain a relevancy score to know how good is a particular result.

```python
query = "What is your approach to national defense"
found_docs = llm_rails.similarity_search_with_score(
    query,
    k=5,
)
```

```python
document, score = found_docs[0]
print(document.page_content)
print(f"\nScore: {score}")
```

```output
But we will do so as the last resort and only when the objectives and mission are clear and achievable, consistent with our values and laws, alongside non-military tools, and the mission is undertaken with the informed consent of the American people.

Our approach to national defense is described in detail in the 2022 National Defense Strategy.

Our starting premise is that a powerful U.S. military helps advance and safeguard vital U.S. national interests by backstopping diplomacy, confronting aggression, deterring conflict, projecting strength, and protecting the American people and their economic interests.

Amid intensifying competition, the military’s role is to maintain and gain warfighting advantages while limiting those of our competitors.

The military will act urgently to sustain and strengthen deterrence, with the PRC as its pacing challenge.

We will make disciplined choices regarding our national defense and focus our attention on the military’s primary responsibilities: to defend the homeland, and deter attacks and aggression against the United States, our allies and partners, while being prepared to fight and win the Nation’s wars should diplomacy and deterrence fail.

To do so, we will combine our strengths to achieve maximum effect in deterring acts of aggression—an approach we refer to as integrated deterrence (see text box on page 22).

We will operate our military using a campaigning mindset—sequencing logically linked military activities to advance strategy-aligned priorities.

And, we will build a resilient force and defense ecosystem to ensure we can perform these functions for decades to come.

We ended America’s longest war in Afghanistan, and with it an era of major military operations to remake other societies, even as we have maintained the capacity to address terrorist threats to the American people as they emerge.

A combat-credible military is the foundation of deterrence and America’s ability to prevail in conflict.

## LLMRails as a Retriever

LLMRails, as all the other LangChain vectorstores, is most often used as a LangChain Retriever:

```python
retriever = llm_rails.as_retriever()
retriever
```

```output
LLMRailsRetriever(vectorstore=<langchain_community.vectorstores.llm_rails.LLMRails object at 0x1235b0e50>)
```

```python
query = "What is your approach to national defense"
retriever.invoke(query)
```

```output
