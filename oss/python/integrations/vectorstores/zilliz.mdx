>[Zilliz Cloud](https://zilliz.com/doc/quick_start) is a fully managed service on cloud for `LF AI Milvus®`,

This notebook shows how to use functionality related to the Zilliz Cloud managed vector database.

You'll need to install `langchain-community` with `pip install -qU langchain-community` to use this integration

To run, you should have a `Zilliz Cloud` instance up and running. Here are the [installation instructions](https://zilliz.com/cloud)

```python
pip install -qU  pymilvus
```

We want to use `OpenAIEmbeddings` so we have to get the OpenAI API Key.

```python
import getpass
import os

if "OPENAI_API_KEY" not in os.environ:
    os.environ["OPENAI_API_KEY"] = getpass.getpass("OpenAI API Key:")
```

```output
OpenAI API Key:········
```

```python
# replace
ZILLIZ_CLOUD_URI = ""  # example: "https://in01-17f69c292d4a5sa.aws-us-west-2.vectordb.zillizcloud.com:19536"
ZILLIZ_CLOUD_USERNAME = ""  # example: "username"
ZILLIZ_CLOUD_PASSWORD = ""  # example: "*********"
ZILLIZ_CLOUD_API_KEY = ""  # example: "*********" (for serverless clusters which can be used as replacements for user and password)
```

```python
from langchain_community.document_loaders import TextLoader
from langchain_community.vectorstores import Milvus
from langchain_openai import OpenAIEmbeddings
from langchain_text_splitters import CharacterTextSplitter
```

```python
from langchain_community.document_loaders import TextLoader

loader = TextLoader("../../how_to/state_of_the_union.txt")
documents = loader.load()
text_splitter = CharacterTextSplitter(chunk_size=1000, chunk_overlap=0)
docs = text_splitter.split_documents(documents)

embeddings = OpenAIEmbeddings()
```

```python
vector_db = Milvus.from_documents(
    docs,
    embeddings,
    connection_args={
        "uri": ZILLIZ_CLOUD_URI,
        "user": ZILLIZ_CLOUD_USERNAME,
        "password": ZILLIZ_CLOUD_PASSWORD,
        # "token": ZILLIZ_CLOUD_API_KEY,  # API key, for serverless clusters which can be used as replacements for user and password
        "secure": True,
    },
)
```

```python
query = "What did the president say about Ketanji Brown Jackson"
docs = vector_db.similarity_search(query)
```

```python
docs[0].page_content
```

```output
'Tonight. I call on the Senate to: Pass the Freedom to Vote Act. Pass the John Lewis Voting Rights Act. And while you’re at it, pass the Disclose Act so Americans can know who is funding our elections. \n\nTonight, I’d like to honor someone who has dedicated his life to serve this country: Justice Stephen Breyer—an Army veteran, Constitutional scholar, and retiring Justice of the United States Supreme Court. Justice Breyer, thank you for your service. \n\nOne of the most serious constitutional responsibilities a President has is nominating someone to serve on the United States Supreme Court. \n\nAnd I did that 4 days ago, when I nominated Circuit Court of Appeals Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson. One of our nation’s top legal minds, who will continue Justice Breyer’s legacy of excellence.'
```

```python
