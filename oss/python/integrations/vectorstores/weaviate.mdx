title: Weaviate
---

This notebook covers how to get started with the Weaviate vector store in LangChain, using the `langchain-weaviate` package.

> [Weaviate](https://weaviate.io/) is an open-source vector database. It allows you to store data objects and vector embeddings from your favorite ML-models, and scale seamlessly into billions of data objects.

To use this integration, you need to have a running Weaviate database instance.

## Minimum versions

This module requires Weaviate `1.23.7` or higher. However, we recommend you use the latest version of Weaviate.

## Connecting to Weaviate

In this notebook, we assume that you have a local instance of Weaviate running on `http://localhost:8080` and port 50051 open for [gRPC traffic](https://weaviate.io/blog/grpc-performance-improvements). So, we will connect to Weaviate with:

```python
weaviate_client = weaviate.connect_to_local()
```

### Other deployment options

Weaviate can be [deployed in many different ways](https://weaviate.io/developers/weaviate/starter-guides/which-weaviate) such as using [Weaviate Cloud Services (WCS)](https://console.weaviate.cloud), [Docker](https://weaviate.io/developers/weaviate/installation/docker-compose) or [Kubernetes](https://weaviate.io/developers/weaviate/installation/kubernetes).

If your Weaviate instance is deployed in another way, [read more here](https://weaviate.io/developers/weaviate/client-libraries/python#instantiate-a-client) about different ways to connect to Weaviate. You can use different [helper functions](https://weaviate.io/developers/weaviate/client-libraries/python#python-client-v4-helper-functions) or [create a custom instance](https://weaviate.io/developers/weaviate/client-libraries/python#python-client-v4-explicit-connection).

> Note that you require a `v4` client API, which will create a `weaviate.WeaviateClient` object.

### Authentication

Some Weaviate instances, such as those running on WCS, have authentication enabled, such as API key and/or username+password authentication.

Read the [client authentication guide](https://weaviate.io/developers/weaviate/client-libraries/python#authentication) for more information, as well as the [in-depth authentication configuration page](https://weaviate.io/developers/weaviate/configuration/authentication).

### Connect to an existing collection (reuse an index)

If you already created a collection in your local Weaviate instance, you can connect to it directly:

```python
from langchain_weaviate import WeaviateVectorStore

store = WeaviateVectorStore(
    client=weaviate_client,
    index_name="Test",
    text_key="text",
)
```

## Installation

```python
# install package
# pip install -Uqq langchain-weaviate
# pip install openai tiktoken langchain
```

## Environment Setup

This notebook uses the OpenAI API through `OpenAIEmbeddings`. We suggest obtaining an OpenAI API key and export it as an environment variable with the name `OPENAI_API_KEY`.

Once this is done, your OpenAI API key will be read automatically. If you are new to environment variables, read more about them [here](https://docs.python.org/3/library/os.html#os.environ) or in [this guide](https://www.twilio.com/en-us/blog/environment-variables-python).

# Usage

## Find objects by similarity

Here is an example of how to find objects by similarity to a query, from data import to querying the Weaviate instance.

### Step 1: Data import

First, we will create data to add to `Weaviate` by loading and chunking the contents of a long text file.

```python
from langchain_community.document_loaders import TextLoader
from langchain_openai import OpenAIEmbeddings
from langchain_text_splitters import CharacterTextSplitter
```

```python
loader = TextLoader("state_of_the_union.txt")
documents = loader.load()
text_splitter = CharacterTextSplitter(chunk_size=1000, chunk_overlap=0)
docs = text_splitter.split_documents(documents)

embeddings = OpenAIEmbeddings()
```

```output
/workspaces/langchain-weaviate/.venv/lib/python3.12/site-packages/langchain_core/_api/deprecation.py:117: LangChainDeprecationWarning: The class `langchain_community.embeddings.openai.OpenAIEmbeddings` was deprecated in langchain-community 0.1.0 and will be removed in 0.2.0. An updated version of the class exists in the langchain-openai package and should be used instead. To use it run `pip install -U langchain-openai` and import as `from langchain_openai import OpenAIEmbeddings`.
  warn_deprecated(
```

Now, we can import the data.

To do so, connect to the Weaviate instance and use the resulting `weaviate_client` object. For example, we can import the documents as shown below:

```python
import weaviate
from langchain_weaviate.vectorstores import WeaviateVectorStore
```

```python
weaviate_client = weaviate.connect_to_local()
db = WeaviateVectorStore.from_documents(docs, embeddings, client=weaviate_client)
```

```output
/workspaces/langchain-weaviate/.venv/lib/python3.12/site-packages/pydantic/main.py:1024: PydanticDeprecatedSince20: The `dict` method is deprecated; use `model_dump` instead. Deprecated in Pydantic V2.0 to be removed in V3.0. See Pydantic V2 Migration Guide at https://errors.pydantic.dev/2.6/migration/
  warnings.warn('The `dict` method is deprecated; use `model_dump` instead.', category=PydanticDeprecatedSince20)
```

### Step 2: Perform the search

We can now perform a similarity search. This will return the most similar documents to the query text, based on the embeddings stored in Weaviate and an equivalent embedding generated from the query text.

```python
query = "What did the president say about Ketanji Brown Jackson"
docs = db.similarity_search(query)

# Print the first 100 characters of each result
for i, doc in enumerate(docs):
    print(f"\nDocument {i + 1}:")
    print(doc.page_content[:100] + "...")
```

```output
Document 1:
Tonight. I call on the Senate to: Pass the Freedom to Vote Act. Pass the John Lewis Voting Rights Ac...

Document 2:

Document 3:
Vice President Harris and I ran for office with a new economic vision for America.

Document 4:

```

You can also add filters, which will either include or exclude results based on the filter conditions. (See [more filter examples](https://weaviate.io/developers/weaviate/search/filters).)

```python
from weaviate.classes.query import Filter

for filter_str in ["blah.txt", "state_of_the_union.txt"]:
    search_filter = Filter.by_property("source").equal(filter_str)
    filtered_search_results = db.similarity_search(query, filters=search_filter)
    print(len(filtered_search_results))
    if filter_str == "state_of_the_union.txt":
        assert len(filtered_search_results) > 0  # There should be at least one result
    else:
        assert len(filtered_search_results) == 0  # There should be no results
```

```output
0
4
```

It is also possible to provide `k`, which is the upper limit of the number of results to return.

```python
search_filter = Filter.by_property("source").equal("state_of_the_union.txt")
filtered_search_results = db.similarity_search(query, filters=search_filter, k=3)
assert len(filtered_search_results) <= 3
```

### Quantify result similarity

You can optionally retrieve a relevance "score". This is a relative score that indicates how good the particular search results is, amongst the pool of search results.

Note that this is relative score, meaning that it should not be used to determine thresholds for relevance. However, it can be used to compare the relevance of different search results within the entire search result set.

```python
docs = db.similarity_search_with_score("country", k=5)

for doc in docs:
    print(f"{doc[1]:.3f}", ":", doc[0].page_content[:100] + "...")
```

```output
0.935 : For that purpose we’ve mobilized American ground forces, air squadrons, and ship deployments to prot...

0.442 : Tonight. I call on the Senate to: Pass the Freedom to Vote Act. Pass the John Lewis Voting Rights Ac...
```

## Search mechanism

`similarity_search` uses Weaviate's [hybrid search](https://weaviate.io/developers/weaviate/api/graphql/search-operators#hybrid).

A hybrid search combines a vector and a keyword search, with `alpha` as the weight of the vector search. The `similarity_search` function allows you to pass additional arguments as kwargs. See this [reference doc](https://weaviate.io/developers/weaviate/api/graphql/search-operators#hybrid) for the available arguments.

So, you can perform a pure keyword search by adding `alpha=0` as shown below:

```python
docs = db.similarity_search(query, alpha=0)
docs[0]
```

```output
Document(page_content='Tonight. I call on the Senate to: Pass the Freedom to Vote Act. Pass the John Lewis Voting Rights Act. And while you’re at it, pass the Disclose Act so Americans can know who is funding our elections. \n\nTonight, I’d like to honor someone who has dedicated his life to serve this country: Justice Stephen Breyer—an Army veteran, Constitutional scholar, and retiring Justice of the United States Supreme Court. Justice Breyer, thank you for your service. \n\nOne of the most serious constitutional responsibilities a President has is nominating someone to serve on the United States Supreme Court. \n\nAnd I did that 4 days ago, when I nominated Circuit Court of Appeals Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson. One of our nation’s top legal minds, who will continue Justice Breyer’s legacy of excellence.', metadata={'source': 'state_of_the_union.txt'})
```

## Persistence

Any data added through `langchain-weaviate` will persist in Weaviate according to its configuration.

WCS instances, for example, are configured to persist data indefinitely, and Docker instances can be set up to persist data in a volume. Read more about [Weaviate's persistence](https://weaviate.io/developers/weaviate/configuration/persistence).

## Multi-tenancy

[Multi-tenancy](https://weaviate.io/developers/weaviate/concepts/data#multi-tenancy) allows you to have a high number of isolated collections of data, with the same collection configuration, in a single Weaviate instance. This is great for multi-user environments such as building a SaaS app, where each end user will have their own isolated data collection.

To use multi-tenancy, the vector store need to be aware of the `tenant` parameter.

So when adding any data, provide the `tenant` parameter as shown below.

```python
db_with_mt = WeaviateVectorStore.from_documents(
    docs, embeddings, client=weaviate_client, tenant="Foo"
)
```

```output
2024-Mar-26 03:40 PM - langchain_weaviate.vectorstores - INFO - Tenant Foo does not exist in index LangChain_30b9273d43b3492db4fb2aba2e0d6871. Creating tenant.
```

And when performing queries, provide the `tenant` parameter also.

```python
db_with_mt.similarity_search(query, tenant="Foo")
```

```output
[Document(page_content='Tonight. I call on the Senate to: Pass the Freedom to Vote Act. Pass the John Lewis Voting Rights Act.

```

## Retriever options

Weaviate can also be used as a retriever

### Maximal marginal relevance search (MMR)

In addition to using similaritysearch  in the retriever object, you can also use `mmr`.

```python
retriever = db.as_retriever(search_type="mmr")
retriever.invoke(query)[0]
```

```output
/workspaces/langchain-weaviate/.venv/lib/python3.12/site-packages/pydantic/main.py:1024: PydanticDeprecatedSince20: The `dict` method is deprecated; use `model_dump` instead. Deprecated in Pydantic V2.0 to be removed in V3.0. See Pydantic V2 Migration Guide at https://errors.pydantic.dev/2.6/migration/
  warnings.warn('The `dict` method is deprecated; use `model_dump` instead.', category=PydanticDeprecatedSince20)
```

```output
Document(page_content='Tonight. I call on the Senate to: Pass the Freedom to Vote Act. Pass the John Lewis Voting Rights Act. And while you’re at it, pass the Disclose Act so Americans can know who is funding our elections. \n\nTonight, I’d like to honor someone who has dedicated his life to serve this country: Justice Stephen Breyer—an Army veteran, Constitutional scholar, and retiring Justice of the United States Supreme Court.

```

# Use with LangChain

A known limitation of large language models (LLMs) is that their training data can be outdated, or not include the specific domain knowledge that you require.

Take a look at the example below:

```python
from langchain_openai import ChatOpenAI

llm = ChatOpenAI(model="gpt-3.5-turbo", temperature=0)
llm.predict("What did the president say about Justice Breyer")
```

```output
/workspaces/langchain-weaviate/.venv/lib/python3.12/site-packages/langchain_core/_api/deprecation.py:117: LangChainDeprecationWarning: The class `langchain_community.chat_models.openai.ChatOpenAI` was deprecated in langchain-community 0.0.10 and will be removed in 0.2.0. An updated version of the class exists in the langchain-openai package and should be used instead. To use it run `pip install -U langchain-openai` and import as `from langchain_openai import ChatOpenAI`.
  warn_deprecated(
/workspaces/langchain-weaviate/.venv/lib/python3.12/site-packages/langchain_core/_api/deprecation.py:117: LangChainDeprecationWarning: The function `predict` was deprecated in LangChain 0.1.7 and will be removed in 0.2.0. Use invoke instead.
  warn_deprecated(

Deprecated in Pydantic V2.0 to be removed in V3.0. See Pydantic V2 Migration Guide at https://errors.pydantic.dev/2.6/migration/
  warnings.warn('The `dict` method is deprecated; use `model_dump` instead.', category=PydanticDeprecatedSince20)
```

```output

```

Vector stores complement LLMs by providing a way to store and retrieve relevant information. This allow you to combine the strengths of LLMs and vector stores, by using LLM's reasoning and linguistic capabilities with vector stores' ability to retrieve relevant information.

Two well-known applications for combining LLMs and vector stores are:

- Question answering
- Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG)

### Question Answering with Sources

Question answering in langchain can be enhanced by the use of vector stores. Let's see how this can be done.

This section uses the `RetrievalQAWithSourcesChain`, which does the lookup of the documents from an Index.

First, we will chunk the text again and import them into the Weaviate vector store.

```python
from langchain.chains import RetrievalQAWithSourcesChain
from langchain_openai import OpenAI
```

```python
with open("state_of_the_union.txt") as f:
    state_of_the_union = f.read()
text_splitter = CharacterTextSplitter(chunk_size=1000, chunk_overlap=0)
texts = text_splitter.split_text(state_of_the_union)
```

```python
docsearch = WeaviateVectorStore.from_texts(
    texts,
    embeddings,
    client=weaviate_client,
    metadatas=[{"source": f"{i}-pl"} for i in range(len(texts))],
)
```

Now we can construct the chain, with the retriever specified:

```python
chain = RetrievalQAWithSourcesChain.from_chain_type(
    OpenAI(temperature=0), chain_type="stuff", retriever=docsearch.as_retriever()
)
```

```output
/workspaces/langchain-weaviate/.venv/lib/python3.12/site-packages/langchain_core/_api/deprecation.py:117: LangChainDeprecationWarning: The class `langchain_community.llms.openai.OpenAI` was deprecated in langchain-community 0.0.10 and will be removed in 0.2.0. An updated version of the class exists in the langchain-openai package and should be used instead. To use it run `pip install -U langchain-openai` and import as `from langchain_openai import OpenAI`.
  warn_deprecated(
```

And run the chain, to ask the question:

```python
chain(
    {"question": "What did the president say about Justice Breyer"},
    return_only_outputs=True,
)
```

```output
/workspaces/langchain-weaviate/.venv/lib/python3.12/site-packages/langchain_core/_api/deprecation.py:117: LangChainDeprecationWarning: The function `__call__` was deprecated in LangChain 0.1.0 and will be removed in 0.2.0. Use invoke instead.
  warn_deprecated(
/workspaces/langchain-weaviate/.venv/lib/python3.12/site-packages/pydantic/main.py:1024: PydanticDeprecatedSince20: The `dict` method is deprecated; use `model_dump` instead. Deprecated in Pydantic V2.0 to be removed in V3.0. See Pydantic V2 Migration Guide at https://errors.pydantic.dev/2.6/migration/
  warnings.warn('The `dict` method is deprecated; use `model_dump` instead.', category=PydanticDeprecatedSince20)
/workspaces/langchain-weaviate/.venv/lib/python3.12/site-packages/pydantic/main.py:1024: PydanticDeprecatedSince20: The `dict` method is deprecated; use `model_dump` instead. Deprecated in Pydantic V2.0 to be removed in V3.0. See Pydantic V2 Migration Guide at https://errors.pydantic.dev/2.6/migration/
  warnings.warn('The `dict` method is deprecated; use `model_dump` instead.', category=PydanticDeprecatedSince20)
```

```output
{'answer': ' The president thanked Justice Stephen Breyer for his service and announced his nomination of Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson to the Supreme Court.\n',
 'sources': '31-pl'}
```

### Retrieval-Augmented Generation

Another very popular application of combining LLMs and vector stores is retrieval-augmented generation (RAG). This is a technique that uses a retriever to find relevant information from a vector store, and then uses an LLM to provide an output based on the retrieved data and a prompt.

We begin with a similar setup:

```python
with open("state_of_the_union.txt") as f:
    state_of_the_union = f.read()
text_splitter = CharacterTextSplitter(chunk_size=1000, chunk_overlap=0)
texts = text_splitter.split_text(state_of_the_union)
```

```python
docsearch = WeaviateVectorStore.from_texts(
    texts,
    embeddings,
    client=weaviate_client,
    metadatas=[{"source": f"{i}-pl"} for i in range(len(texts))],
)

retriever = docsearch.as_retriever()
```

We need to construct a template for the RAG model so that the retrieved information will be populated in the template.

```python
from langchain_core.prompts import ChatPromptTemplate

template = """You are an assistant for question-answering tasks. Use the following pieces of retrieved context to answer the question. If you don't know the answer, just say that you don't know. Use three sentences maximum and keep the answer concise.
Question: {question}
Context: {context}
Answer:
"""
prompt = ChatPromptTemplate.from_template(template)

print(prompt)
```

```output
input_variables=['context', 'question'] messages=[HumanMessagePromptTemplate(prompt=PromptTemplate(input_variables=['context', 'question'], template="You are an assistant for question-answering tasks. Use the following pieces of retrieved context to answer the question. If you don't know the answer, just say that you don't know. Use three sentences maximum and keep the answer concise.\nQuestion: {question}\nContext: {context}\nAnswer:\n"))]
```

```python
from langchain_openai import ChatOpenAI

llm = ChatOpenAI(model="gpt-3.5-turbo", temperature=0)
```

And running the cell, we get a very similar output.

```python
from langchain_core.output_parsers import StrOutputParser
from langchain_core.runnables import RunnablePassthrough

rag_chain = (
    {"context": retriever, "question": RunnablePassthrough()}
    | prompt
    | llm
    | StrOutputParser()
)

rag_chain.invoke("What did the president say about Justice Breyer")
```

```output
/workspaces/langchain-weaviate/.venv/lib/python3.12/site-packages/pydantic/main.py:1024: PydanticDeprecatedSince20: The `dict` method is deprecated; use `model_dump` instead. Deprecated in Pydantic V2.0 to be removed in V3.0. See Pydantic V2 Migration Guide at https://errors.pydantic.dev/2.6/migration/
  warnings.warn('The `dict` method is deprecated; use `model_dump` instead.', category=PydanticDeprecatedSince20)
/workspaces/langchain-weaviate/.venv/lib/python3.12/site-packages/pydantic/main.py:1024: PydanticDeprecatedSince20: The `dict` method is deprecated; use `model_dump` instead. Deprecated in Pydantic V2.0 to be removed in V3.0. See Pydantic V2 Migration Guide at https://errors.pydantic.dev/2.6/migration/
  warnings.warn('The `dict` method is deprecated; use `model_dump` instead.', category=PydanticDeprecatedSince20)
```

```output
"The president honored Justice Stephen Breyer for his service to the country as an Army veteran, Constitutional scholar, and retiring Justice of the United States Supreme Court. The president also mentioned nominating Circuit Court of Appeals Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson to continue Justice Breyer's legacy of excellence. The president expressed gratitude towards Justice Breyer and highlighted the importance of nominating someone to serve on the United States Supreme Court."
```

But note that since the template is upto you to construct, you can customize it to your needs.
