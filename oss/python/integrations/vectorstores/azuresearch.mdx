title: Azure AI Search
---

[Azure AI Search](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/search/search-what-is-azure-search) (formerly known as `Azure Search` and `Azure Cognitive Search`) is a cloud search service that gives developers infrastructure, APIs, and tools for information retrieval of vector, keyword, and hybrid queries at scale.

You'll need to install `langchain-community` with `pip install -qU langchain-community` to use this integration

## Install Azure AI Search SDK

Use azure-search-documents package version 11.4.0 or later.

```python
pip install -qU  azure-search-documents
pip install -qU  azure-identity
```

## Import required libraries

[`OpenAIEmbeddings`](https://reference.langchain.com/python/integrations/langchain_openai/OpenAIEmbeddings) is assumed, but if you're using Azure OpenAI, import [`AzureOpenAIEmbeddings`](https://reference.langchain.com/python/integrations/langchain_openai/AzureOpenAIEmbeddings) instead.

```python
import os

from langchain_community.vectorstores.azuresearch import AzureSearch
from langchain_openai import AzureOpenAIEmbeddings, OpenAIEmbeddings
```

## Configure OpenAI settings

Set variables for your OpenAI provider. You need either an [OpenAI account](https://platform.openai.com/docs/quickstart?context=python) or an [Azure OpenAI account](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-services/openai/how-to/create-resource) to generate the embeddings.

```python
# Option 1: use an OpenAI account
openai_api_key: str = "PLACEHOLDER FOR YOUR API KEY"
openai_api_version: str = "2023-05-15"
model: str = "text-embedding-ada-002"
```

```python
# Option 2: use an Azure OpenAI account with a deployment of an embedding model
azure_endpoint: str = "PLACEHOLDER FOR YOUR AZURE OPENAI ENDPOINT"
azure_openai_api_key: str = "PLACEHOLDER FOR YOUR AZURE OPENAI KEY"
azure_openai_api_version: str = "2023-05-15"
azure_deployment: str = "text-embedding-ada-002"
```

## Configure vector store settings

You need an [Azure subscription](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/free/search) and [Azure AI Search service](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/search/search-create-service-portal) to use this vector store integration. No-cost versions are available for small and limited workloads.

Set variables for your Azure AI Search URL and admin API key. You can get these variables from the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/HubsExtension/BrowseResourceBlade/resourceType/Microsoft.Search%2FsearchServices).

```python
vector_store_address: str = "YOUR_AZURE_SEARCH_ENDPOINT"
vector_store_password: str = "YOUR_AZURE_SEARCH_ADMIN_KEY"
```

## Create embeddings and vector store instances

Create instances of the [`OpenAIEmbeddings`](https://reference.langchain.com/python/integrations/langchain_openai/OpenAIEmbeddings) and AzureSearch classes. When you complete this step, you should have an empty search index on your Azure AI Search resource. The integration module provides a default schema.

```python
# Option 1: Use OpenAIEmbeddings with OpenAI account
embeddings: OpenAIEmbeddings = OpenAIEmbeddings(
    openai_api_key=openai_api_key, openai_api_version=openai_api_version, model=model
)
```

```python
# Option 2: Use AzureOpenAIEmbeddings with an Azure account
embeddings: AzureOpenAIEmbeddings = AzureOpenAIEmbeddings(
    azure_deployment=azure_deployment,
    openai_api_version=azure_openai_api_version,
    azure_endpoint=azure_endpoint,
    api_key=azure_openai_api_key,
)
```

## Create vector store instance

Create instance of the AzureSearch class using the embeddings from above

```python
index_name: str = "langchain-vector-demo"
vector_store: AzureSearch = AzureSearch(
    azure_search_endpoint=vector_store_address,
    azure_search_key=vector_store_password,
    index_name=index_name,
    embedding_function=embeddings.embed_query,
)
```

```python
# Specify additional properties for the Azure client such as the following https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-python/blob/main/sdk/core/azure-core/README.md#configurations
vector_store: AzureSearch = AzureSearch(
    azure_search_endpoint=vector_store_address,
    azure_search_key=vector_store_password,
    index_name=index_name,
    embedding_function=embeddings.embed_query,
    # Configure max retries for the Azure client
    additional_search_client_options={"retry_total": 4},
)
```

## Insert text and embeddings into vector store

This step loads, chunks, and vectorizes the sample document, and then indexes the content into a search index on Azure AI Search.

```python
from langchain_community.document_loaders import TextLoader
from langchain_text_splitters import CharacterTextSplitter

loader = TextLoader("../../how_to/state_of_the_union.txt", encoding="utf-8")

documents = loader.load()
text_splitter = CharacterTextSplitter(chunk_size=1000, chunk_overlap=0)
docs = text_splitter.split_documents(documents)

vector_store.add_documents(documents=docs)
```

```output

## Perform a vector similarity search

Execute a pure vector similarity search using the similarity_search() method:

```python
# Perform a similarity search
docs = vector_store.similarity_search(
    query="What did the president say about Ketanji Brown Jackson",
    k=3,
    search_type="similarity",
)
print(docs[0].page_content)
```

```output
Tonight. I call on the Senate to: Pass the Freedom to Vote Act. Pass the John Lewis Voting Rights Act. And while you’re at it, pass the Disclose Act so Americans can know who is funding our elections.

Tonight, I’d like to honor someone who has dedicated his life to serve this country: Justice Stephen Breyer—an Army veteran, Constitutional scholar, and retiring Justice of the United States Supreme Court. Justice Breyer, thank you for your service.

One of the most serious constitutional responsibilities a President has is nominating someone to serve on the United States Supreme Court.

And I did that 4 days ago, when I nominated Circuit Court of Appeals Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson. One of our nation’s top legal minds, who will continue Justice Breyer’s legacy of excellence.
```

## Perform a vector similarity search with relevance scores

Execute a pure vector similarity search using the similarity_search_with_relevance_scores() method. Queries that don't meet the threshold requirements are exluded.

```python
docs_and_scores = vector_store.similarity_search_with_relevance_scores(
    query="What did the president say about Ketanji Brown Jackson",
    k=4,
    score_threshold=0.80,
)
from pprint import pprint

pprint(docs_and_scores)
```

## Perform a hybrid search

Execute hybrid search using the search_type or hybrid_search() method. Vector and nonvector text fields are queried in parallel, results are merged, and top matches of the unified result set are returned.

```python
# Perform a hybrid search using the search_type parameter
docs = vector_store.similarity_search(
    query="What did the president say about Ketanji Brown Jackson",

## Custom schemas and queries

This section shows you how to replace the default schema with a custom schema.

### Create a new index with custom filterable fields

This schema shows field definitions. It's the default schema, plus several new fields attributed as filterable. Because it's using the default vector configuration, you won't see vector configuration or vector profile overrides here. The name of the default vector profile is "myHnswProfile" and it's using a vector configuration of Hierarchical Navigable Small World (HNSW) for indexing and queries against the content_vector field.

There's no data for this schema in this step. When you execute the cell, you should get an empty index on Azure AI Search.

```python
from azure.search.documents.indexes.models import (
    ScoringProfile,
    SearchableField,
    SearchField,
    SearchFieldDataType,
    SimpleField,
    TextWeights,
)

#  Replace OpenAIEmbeddings with AzureOpenAIEmbeddings if Azure OpenAI is your provider.
embeddings: OpenAIEmbeddings = OpenAIEmbeddings(
    openai_api_key=openai_api_key, openai_api_version=openai_api_version, model=model
)
embedding_function = embeddings.embed_query

fields = [
    SimpleField(
        name="id",
        type=SearchFieldDataType.String,
        key=True,
        filterable=True,
    ),
    SearchableField(
        name="content",
        type=SearchFieldDataType.String,
        searchable=True,
    ),
    SearchField(
        name="content_vector",
        type=SearchFieldDataType.Collection(SearchFieldDataType.Single),
        searchable=True,
        vector_search_dimensions=len(embedding_function("Text")),
        vector_search_profile_name="myHnswProfile",
    ),
    SearchableField(
        name="metadata",
        type=SearchFieldDataType.String,
        searchable=True,
    ),
    # Additional field to store the title
    SearchableField(
        name="title",
        type=SearchFieldDataType.String,
        searchable=True,
    ),
    # Additional field for filtering on document source
    SimpleField(
        name="source",
        type=SearchFieldDataType.String,
        filterable=True,
    ),
]

index_name: str = "langchain-vector-demo-custom"

vector_store: AzureSearch = AzureSearch(
    azure_search_endpoint=vector_store_address,
    azure_search_key=vector_store_password,
    index_name=index_name,
    embedding_function=embedding_function,
    fields=fields,
)
```

### Add data and perform a query that includes a filter

This example adds data to the vector store based on the custom schema. It loads text into the title and source fields. The source field is filterable. The sample query in this section filters the results based on content in the source field.

```python
# Data in the metadata dictionary with a corresponding field in the index will be added to the index.
# In this example, the metadata dictionary contains a title, a source, and a random field.
# The title and the source are added to the index as separate fields, but the random value is ignored because it's not defined in the schema.
# The random field is only stored in the metadata field.
vector_store.add_texts(
    ["Test 1", "Test 2", "Test 3"],
    [
        {"title": "Title 1", "source": "A", "random": "10290"},
        {"title": "Title 2", "source": "A", "random": "48392"},
        {"title": "Title 3", "source": "B", "random": "32893"},
    ],
)
```

```output
['ZjhmMTg0NTEtMjgwNC00N2M0LWFiZGEtMDllMGU1Mzk1NWRm',
 'MzQwYWUwZDEtNDJkZC00MzgzLWIwMzItYzMwOGZkYTRiZGRi',
 'ZjFmOWVlYTQtODRiMC00YTY3LTk2YjUtMzY1NDBjNjY5ZmQ2']
```

```python
res = vector_store.similarity_search(query="Test 3 source1", k=3, search_type="hybrid")
res
```

```output
[Document(page_content='Test 3', metadata={'title': 'Title 3', 'source': 'B', 'random': '32893'}),
 Document(page_content='Test 1', metadata={'title': 'Title 1', 'source': 'A', 'random': '10290'}),
 Document(page_content='Test 2', metadata={'title': 'Title 2', 'source': 'A', 'random': '48392'})]
```

```python
res = vector_store.similarity_search(
    query="Test 3 source1", k=3, search_type="hybrid", filters="source eq 'A'"
)
res
```

```output
[Document(page_content='Test 1', metadata={'title': 'Title 1', 'source': 'A', 'random': '10290'}),
 Document(page_content='Test 2', metadata={'title': 'Title 2', 'source': 'A', 'random': '48392'})]
```

### Create a new index with a scoring profile

Here's another custom schema that includes a scoring profile definition. A scoring profile is used for relevance tuning of nonvector content, which is helpful in hybrid search scenarios.

```python
from azure.search.documents.indexes.models import (
    FreshnessScoringFunction,
    FreshnessScoringParameters,
    ScoringProfile,
    SearchableField,
    SearchField,
    SearchFieldDataType,
    SimpleField,
    TextWeights,
)

#  Replace OpenAIEmbeddings with AzureOpenAIEmbeddings if Azure OpenAI is your provider.
embeddings: OpenAIEmbeddings = OpenAIEmbeddings(
    openai_api_key=openai_api_key, openai_api_version=openai_api_version, model=model
)
embedding_function = embeddings.embed_query

fields = [
    SimpleField(
        name="id",
        type=SearchFieldDataType.String,
        key=True,
        filterable=True,
    ),
    SearchableField(
        name="content",
        type=SearchFieldDataType.String,
        searchable=True,
    ),
    SearchField(
        name="content_vector",
        type=SearchFieldDataType.Collection(SearchFieldDataType.Single),
        searchable=True,
        vector_search_dimensions=len(embedding_function("Text")),
        vector_search_profile_name="myHnswProfile",
    ),
    SearchableField(
        name="metadata",
        type=SearchFieldDataType.String,
        searchable=True,
    ),
    # Additional field to store the title
    SearchableField(
        name="title",
        type=SearchFieldDataType.String,
        searchable=True,
    ),
    # Additional field for filtering on document source
    SimpleField(
        name="source",
        type=SearchFieldDataType.String,
        filterable=True,
    ),
    # Additional data field for last doc update
    SimpleField(
        name="last_update",
        type=SearchFieldDataType.DateTimeOffset,
        searchable=True,
        filterable=True,
    ),
