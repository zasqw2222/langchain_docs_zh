title: Baidu Cloud ElasticSearch VectorSearch
---

>[Baidu Cloud VectorSearch](https://cloud.baidu.com/doc/BES/index.html?from=productToDoc) is a fully managed, enterprise-level distributed search and analysis service which is 100% compatible to open source. Baidu Cloud VectorSearch provides low-cost, high-performance, and reliable retrieval and analysis platform level product services for structured/unstructured data. As a vector database , it supports multiple index types and similarity distance methods.

>`Baidu Cloud ElasticSearch` provides a privilege management mechanism, for you to  configure the cluster privileges freely, so as to further ensure data security.

This notebook shows how to use functionality related to the `Baidu Cloud ElasticSearch VectorStore`.
To run, you should have an [Baidu Cloud ElasticSearch](https://cloud.baidu.com/product/bes.html) instance up and running:

Read the [help document](https://cloud.baidu.com/doc/BES/s/8llyn0hh4 ) to quickly familiarize and configure Baidu Cloud ElasticSearch instance.

After the instance is up and running, follow these steps to split documents, get embeddings, connect to the baidu cloud elasticsearch instance, index documents, and perform vector retrieval.

We need to install the following Python packages first.

```python
pip install -qU langchain-community elasticsearch == 7.11.0
```

First, we want to use `QianfanEmbeddings` so we have to get the Qianfan AK and SK. Details for QianFan is related to [Baidu Qianfan Workshop](https://cloud.baidu.com/product/wenxinworkshop)

```python
import getpass
import os

if "QIANFAN_AK" not in os.environ:
    os.environ["QIANFAN_AK"] = getpass.getpass("Your Qianfan AK:")
if "QIANFAN_SK" not in os.environ:
    os.environ["QIANFAN_SK"] = getpass.getpass("Your Qianfan SK:")
```

Secondly, split documents and get embeddings.

```python
from langchain_community.document_loaders import TextLoader
from langchain_text_splitters import CharacterTextSplitter

loader = TextLoader("../../../state_of_the_union.txt")
documents = loader.load()
text_splitter = CharacterTextSplitter(chunk_size=1000, chunk_overlap=0)
docs = text_splitter.split_documents(documents)

from langchain_community.embeddings import QianfanEmbeddingsEndpoint

embeddings = QianfanEmbeddingsEndpoint()
```

Then, create a Baidu ElasticeSearch accessable instance.

```python
# Create a bes instance and index docs.
from langchain_community.vectorstores import BESVectorStore

bes = BESVectorStore.from_documents(
    documents=docs,
    embedding=embeddings,
    bes_url="your bes cluster url",
    index_name="your vector index",
)
bes.client.indices.refresh(index="your vector index")
```

Finally, Query and retrieve data

```python
query = "What did the president say about Ketanji Brown Jackson"
docs = bes.similarity_search(query)
print(docs[0].page_content)
```
