title: Google Cloud Text-to-Speech
---

>[Google Cloud Text-to-Speech](https://cloud.google.com/text-to-speech) enables developers to synthesize natural-sounding speech with 100+ voices, available in multiple languages and variants. It applies DeepMind’s groundbreaking research in WaveNet and Google’s powerful neural networks to deliver the highest fidelity possible.
>
>It supports multiple languages, including English, German, Polish, Spanish, Italian, French, Portuguese, and Hindi.

This notebook shows how to interact with the `Google Cloud Text-to-Speech API` to achieve speech synthesis capabilities.

First, you need to set up an Google Cloud project. You can follow the instructions [here](https://cloud.google.com/text-to-speech/docs/before-you-begin).

```python
!pip install -U langchain-google-community[texttospeech]
```

## Instantiation

```python
from langchain_google_community import TextToSpeechTool
```

## Deprecated GoogleCloudTextToSpeechTool

```python
from langchain_community.tools import GoogleCloudTextToSpeechTool
```

```python
text_to_speak = "Hello world!"

tts = GoogleCloudTextToSpeechTool()
tts.name
```

We can generate audio, save it to the temporary file and then play it.

```python
speech_file = tts.run(text_to_speak)
```
