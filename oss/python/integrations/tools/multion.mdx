title: MultiOn Toolkit
---

[MultiON](https://www.multion.ai/blog/multion-building-a-brighter-future-for-humanity-with-ai-agents) has built an AI Agent that can interact with a broad array of web services and applications.

This notebook walks you through connecting LangChain to the `MultiOn` Client in your browser.

This enables custom agentic workflow that utilize the power of MultiON agents.

To use this toolkit, you will need to add `MultiOn Extension` to your browser:

* Create a [MultiON account](https://app.multion.ai/login?callbackUrl=%2Fprofile).
* Add  [MultiOn extension for Chrome](https://multion.notion.site/Download-MultiOn-ddddcfe719f94ab182107ca2612c07a5).

```python
pip install -qU  multion langchain -q
```

```python
pip install -qU langchain-community
```

```python
from langchain_community.agent_toolkits import MultionToolkit

toolkit = MultionToolkit()
toolkit
```

```output
MultionToolkit()
```

```python
tools = toolkit.get_tools()
tools
```

```output
[MultionCreateSession(), MultionUpdateSession(), MultionCloseSession()]
```

## MultiOn Setup

Once you have created an account, create an API key at [app.multion.ai/](https://app.multion.ai/).

Login to establish connection with your extension.

```python
# Authorize connection to your Browser extention
import multion

multion.login()
```

```output
Logged in.
```

## Use Multion Toolkit within an Agent

This will use MultiON chrome extension to perform the desired actions.

We can run the below, and view the [trace](https://smith.langchain.com/public/34aaf36d-204a-4ce3-a54e-4a0976f09670/r) to see:

* The agent uses the `create_multion_session` tool
* It then uses MultiON to execute the query

```python
from langchain_classic import hub
from langchain.agents import AgentExecutor, create_openai_functions_agent
from langchain_openai import ChatOpenAI
```

```python
# Prompt
instructions = """You are an assistant."""
base_prompt = hub.pull("langchain-ai/openai-functions-template")
prompt = base_prompt.partial(instructions=instructions)
```

```python
# LLM
llm = ChatOpenAI(temperature=0)
```

```python
# Agent
agent = create_openai_functions_agent(llm, toolkit.get_tools(), prompt)
agent_executor = AgentExecutor(
    agent=agent,
    tools=toolkit.get_tools(),
    verbose=False,
)
```

```python
agent_executor.invoke(
    {
        "input": "Use multion to explain how AlphaCodium works, a recently released code language model."
    }
)
```

```output
WARNING: 'new_session' is deprecated and will be removed in a future version. Use 'create_session' instead.
WARNING: 'update_session' is deprecated and will be removed in a future version. Use 'step_session' instead.
WARNING: 'update_session' is deprecated and will be removed in a future version. Use 'step_session' instead.

```

```output
{'input': 'Use multion to how AlphaCodium works, a recently released code language model.',
 'output': 'AlphaCodium is a recently released code language model that is designed to assist developers in writing code more efficiently. It is based on advanced machine learning techniques and natural language processing. AlphaCodium can understand and generate code in multiple programming languages, making it a versatile tool for developers.\n\nThe model is trained on a large dataset of code snippets and programming examples, allowing it to learn patterns and best practices in coding. It can provide suggestions and auto-complete code based on the context and the desired outcome.\n\nAlphaCodium also has the ability to analyze code and identify potential errors or bugs. It can offer recommendations for improving code quality and performance.\n\nOverall, AlphaCodium aims to enhance the coding experience by providing intelligent assistance and reducing the time and effort required to write high-quality code.\n\nFor more detailed information, you can visit the official AlphaCodium website or refer to the documentation and resources available online.\n\nI hope this helps! Let me know if you have any other questions.'}
