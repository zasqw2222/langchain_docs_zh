title: OpenWeatherMap

This notebook goes over how to use the `OpenWeatherMap` component to fetch weather information.

First, you need to sign up for an `OpenWeatherMap API` key:

1. Go to OpenWeatherMap and sign up for an API key [here](https://openweathermap.org/api/)
2. pip install pyowm

Then we will need to set some environment variables:

1. Save your API KEY into OPENWEATHERMAP_API_KEY env variable

## Use the wrapper

```python
pip install -qU pyowm
```

```output
Note: you may need to restart the kernel to use updated packages.
```

```python
import os

from langchain_community.utilities import OpenWeatherMapAPIWrapper

os.environ["OPENWEATHERMAP_API_KEY"] = ""

weather = OpenWeatherMapAPIWrapper()
```

```python
weather_data = weather.run("London,GB")
print(weather_data)
```

```output
In London,GB, the current weather is as follows:
Detailed status: overcast clouds
Wind speed: 4.12 m/s, direction: 10°
Humidity: 51%
Temperature:
  - Current: 12.82°C
  - High: 13.98°C
  - Low: 12.01°C
  - Feels like: 11.49°C
Rain: {}
Heat index: None
Cloud cover: 100%
```

## Use the tool

```python
import os

from langchain.agents import create_agent


os.environ["OPENAI_API_KEY"] = ""
os.environ["OPENWEATHERMAP_API_KEY"] = ""

tools = [weather.run]
agent = create_agent("gpt-4.1-mini", tools)
```

```python
input_message = {
    "role": "user",
    "content": "What's the weather like in London?",
}

for step in agent.stream(
    {"messages": [input_message]},
    stream_mode="values",
):
    step["messages"][-1].pretty_print()
```

```output
================================ Human Message =================================
