title: Twilio
---

This notebook goes over how to use the [Twilio](https://www.twilio.com) API wrapper to send a message through SMS or [Twilio Messaging Channels](https://www.twilio.com/docs/messaging/channels).

Twilio Messaging Channels facilitates integrations with 3rd party messaging apps and lets you send messages through WhatsApp Business Platform (GA), Facebook Messenger (Public Beta) and Google Business Messages (Private Beta).

## Setup

To use this tool you need to install the Python Twilio package `twilio`

```python
pip install -qU  twilio
```

You'll also need to set up a Twilio account and get your credentials. You'll need your Account String Identifier (SID) and your Auth Token. You'll also need a number to send messages from.

You can either pass these in to the TwilioAPIWrapper as named parameters `account_sid`, `auth_token`, `from_number`, or you can set the environment variables `TWILIO_ACCOUNT_SID`, `TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN`, `TWILIO_FROM_NUMBER`.

## Sending an SMS

```python
from langchain_community.utilities.twilio import TwilioAPIWrapper
```

```python
twilio = TwilioAPIWrapper(
    #     account_sid="foo",
    #     auth_token="bar",
    #     from_number="baz,"
)
```

```python
twilio.run("hello world", "+16162904619")
```

## Sending a WhatsApp Message

You'll need to link your WhatsApp Business Account with Twilio. You'll also need to make sure that the number to send messages from is configured as a WhatsApp Enabled Sender on Twilio and registered with WhatsApp.

```python
from langchain_community.utilities.twilio import TwilioAPIWrapper
```

```python
twilio = TwilioAPIWrapper(
    #     account_sid="foo",
    #     auth_token="bar",
    #     from_number="whatsapp: baz,"
)
```

```python
twilio.run("hello world", "whatsapp: +16162904619")
```
