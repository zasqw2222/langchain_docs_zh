> [Bing Search](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/bing/search-apis/bing-web-search/) is an Azure service and enables safe, ad-free, location-aware search results, surfacing relevant information from billions of web documents. Help your users find what they're looking for from the world-wide-web by harnessing Bing's ability to comb billions of webpages, images, videos, and news with a single API call.

## Setup

Following the [instruction](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/bing/search-apis/bing-web-search/create-bing-search-service-resource) to create Azure Bing Search v7 service, and get the subscription key

The integration lives in the `langchain-community` package.

```python
pip install -U langchain-community
```

```python
import getpass
import os

os.environ["BING_SUBSCRIPTION_KEY"] = getpass.getpass()
os.environ["BING_SEARCH_URL"] = "https://api.bing.microsoft.com/v7.0/search"
```

```python
from langchain_community.utilities import BingSearchAPIWrapper
```

```python
search = BingSearchAPIWrapper(k=4)
```

```python
search.run("python")
```

```python
search = BingSearchAPIWrapper(k=1)
```

```python
search.run("python")
```

```output
'<b>Python</b> is a versatile and powerful language that lets you work quickly and integrate systems more effectively. Learn how to get started, download the latest version, access documentation, find jobs, and join the Python community.'

## Metadata Results

Run query through BingSearch and return snippet, title, and link metadata.

- Snippet: The description of the result.
- Title: The title of the result.
- Link: The link to the result.

```python
search = BingSearchAPIWrapper()
```

```python
search.results("apples", 5)

## Chaining

We show here how to use it as part of an [agent](/oss/python/langchain/agents). We use the OpenAI Functions Agent, so we will need to setup and install the required dependencies for that. We will also use [LangSmith Hub](https://smith.langchain.com/hub) to pull the prompt from, so we will need to install that.

```python
# you need a model to use in the chain
pip install -qU langchain langchain-openai langchainhub langchain-community
```

```python
import getpass
import os

from langchain_classic import hub
from langchain.agents import AgentExecutor, create_tool_calling_agent
from langchain_openai import AzureChatOpenAI

os.environ["AZURE_OPENAI_API_KEY"] = getpass.getpass()
os.environ["AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT"] = "https://<your-endpoint>.openai.azure.com/"
os.environ["AZURE_OPENAI_API_VERSION"] = "2023-06-01-preview"
os.environ["AZURE_OPENAI_DEPLOYMENT_NAME"] = "<your-deployment-name>"

instructions = """You are an assistant."""
base_prompt = hub.pull("langchain-ai/openai-functions-template")
prompt = base_prompt.partial(instructions=instructions)
llm = AzureChatOpenAI(
    openai_api_key=os.environ["AZURE_OPENAI_API_KEY"],
    azure_endpoint=os.environ["AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT"],
    azure_deployment=os.environ["AZURE_OPENAI_DEPLOYMENT_NAME"],
    openai_api_version=os.environ["AZURE_OPENAI_API_VERSION"],
)
tool = BingSearchResults(api_wrapper=api_wrapper)
tools = [tool]
agent = create_tool_calling_agent(llm, tools, prompt)
agent_executor = AgentExecutor(
    agent=agent,
    tools=tools,
    verbose=True,
)
agent_executor.invoke({"input": "What happened in the latest burning man floods?"})
```

```output
> Entering new AgentExecutor chain...

Invoking: `bing_search_results_json` with `{'query': 'latest burning man floods'}`
