This notebook goes over how to use the Google Jobs Tool to fetch current Job postings.

First, you need to sign up for an `SerpApi key` key at: [serpapi.com/users/sign_up](https://serpapi.com/users/sign_up) and get your api key here: [serpapi.com/manage-api-key](https://serpapi.com/manage-api-key).

Then you must install `google-search-results` with the command:
    `pip install google-search-results`

Then you will need to set the environment variable `SERPAPI_API_KEY` to your `SerpApi key`

If you are using conda environment, you can set up using the following commands in kernal:
conda activate [your env name]
conda env confiv vars SERPAPI_API_KEY='[your serp api key]'

## Use the Tool

```python
pip install -qU google-search-results langchain-community
```

```output
Note: you may need to restart the kernel to use updated packages.
```

```python
import os

os.environ["SERPAPI_API_KEY"] = ""
```

```python
from langchain_community.tools.google_jobs import GoogleJobsQueryRun
from langchain_community.utilities.google_jobs import GoogleJobsAPIWrapper

tool = GoogleJobsQueryRun(api_wrapper=GoogleJobsAPIWrapper())
```

```python
