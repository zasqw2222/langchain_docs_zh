```

```python
from langchain_community.tools import BraveSearch
```

```python
api_key = "API KEY"
```

```python
tool = BraveSearch.from_api_key(api_key=api_key, search_kwargs={"count": 3})

# or if you want to get the api key from environment variable BRAVE_SEARCH_API_KEY, and leave search_kwargs empty
# tool = BraveSearch()

# or if you want to provide just the api key, and leave search_kwargs empty
# tool = BraveSearch.from_api_key(api_key=api_key)

# or if you want to provide just the search_kwargs and read the api key from the BRAVE_SEARCH_API_KEY environment variable
# tool = BraveSearch.from_search_kwargs(search_kwargs={"count": 3})
```

```python
tool.run("obama middle name")
