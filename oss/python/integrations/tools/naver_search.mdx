import getpass
import os

if not os.environ.get("NAVER_CLIENT_ID"):
    os.environ["NAVER_CLIENT_ID"] = getpass.getpass("Enter your Naver Client ID:\n")

if not os.environ.get("NAVER_CLIENT_SECRET"):
    os.environ["NAVER_CLIENT_SECRET"] = getpass.getpass(
        "Enter your Naver Client Secret:\n"
    )
```

## Use within an agent

The Naver Search tool can be integrated into LangChain agents for more complex tasks. Below we demonstrate how to set up an agent that can search Naver for current information.

```python
from langchain_openai import ChatOpenAI

model = ChatOpenAI(model="gpt-4o-mini")

system_prompt = """
You are a helpful assistant that can search the web for information.
"""
```

```python
from langchain_naver_community.tool import NaverNewsSearch
from langchain.agents import create_agent


tools = [NaverNewsSearch()]

agent_executor = create_agent(
    model,
    tools,
    prompt=system_prompt,
)
```

Now we can run the agent with a query.

```python
query = "What is the weather in Seoul?"
result = agent_executor.invoke({"messages": [("human", query)]})
result["messages"][-1].content
```
