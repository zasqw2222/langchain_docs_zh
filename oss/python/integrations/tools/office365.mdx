title: Office365 Toolkit
---

>[Microsoft 365](https://www.office.com/) is a product family of productivity software, collaboration and cloud-based services owned by `Microsoft`.
>
>Note: `Office 365` was rebranded as `Microsoft 365`.

This notebook walks through connecting LangChain to `Office365` email and calendar.

To use this toolkit, you need to set up your credentials explained in the [Microsoft Graph authentication and authorization overview](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/auth/). Once you've received a CLIENT_ID and CLIENT_SECRET, you can input them as environmental variables below.

You can also use the [authentication instructions from here](https://o365.github.io/python-o365/latest/getting_started.html#oauth-setup-pre-requisite).

```python
pip install -qU  O365
pip install -qU  beautifulsoup4  # This is optional but is useful for parsing HTML messages
pip install -qU langchain-community
```

## Assign Environmental Variables

The toolkit will read the `CLIENT_ID` and `CLIENT_SECRET` environmental variables to authenticate the user so you need to set them here. You will also need to set your `OPENAI_API_KEY` to use the agent later.

```python
# Set environmental variables here
```

## Create the Toolkit and Get Tools

To start, you need to create the toolkit, so you can access its tools later.

```python
from langchain_community.agent_toolkits import O365Toolkit

toolkit = O365Toolkit()
tools = toolkit.get_tools()
tools
```

```output
[O365SearchEvents(name='events_search', description=" Use this tool to search for the user's calendar events. The input must be the start and end datetimes for the search query. The output is a JSON list of all the events in the user's calendar between the start and end times. You can assume that the user can  not schedule any meeting over existing meetings, and that the user is busy during meetings. Any times without events are free for the user. ", args_schema=<class 'langchain_community.tools.office365.events_search.SearchEventsInput'>, return_direct=False, verbose=False, callbacks=None, callback_manager=None, handle_tool_error=False, account=Account Client Id: f32a022c-3c4c-4d10-a9d8-f6a9a9055302),
 O365CreateDraftMessage(name='create_email_draft', description='Use this tool to create a draft email with the provided message fields.', args_schema=<class 'langchain_community.tools.office365.create_draft_message.CreateDraftMessageSchema'>, return_direct=False, verbose=False, callbacks=None, callback_manager=None, handle_tool_error=False, account=Account Client Id: f32a022c-3c4c-4d10-a9d8-f6a9a9055302),
 O365SearchEmails(name='messages_search', description='Use this tool to search for email messages. The input must be a valid Microsoft Graph v1.0 $search query.

```

## Use within an Agent

```python
from langchain.agents import AgentType, initialize_agent
from langchain_openai import OpenAI
```

```python
llm = OpenAI(temperature=0)
agent = initialize_agent(
    tools=toolkit.get_tools(),
    llm=llm,
    verbose=False,
    agent=AgentType.STRUCTURED_CHAT_ZERO_SHOT_REACT_DESCRIPTION,
)
```

```python
agent.run(
    "Create an email draft for me to edit of a letter from the perspective of a sentient parrot"
    " who is looking to collaborate on some research with her"
    " estranged friend, a cat. Under no circumstances may you send the message, however."
)
```

```output
'The draft email was created correctly.'
```

```python
agent.run(
    "Could you search in my drafts folder and let me know if any of them are about collaboration?"
)
```

```output
"I found one draft in your drafts folder about collaboration. It was sent on 2023-06-16T18:22:17+0000 and the subject was 'Collaboration Request'."
```

```python
agent.run(
    "Can you schedule a 30 minute meeting with a sentient parrot to discuss research collaborations on October 3, 2023 at 2 pm Easter Time?"
)
```

```output
/home/vscode/langchain-py-env/lib/python3.11/site-packages/O365/utils/windows_tz.py:639: PytzUsageWarning: The zone attribute is specific to pytz's interface; please migrate to a new time zone provider.

  timezone = date_time.tzinfo.zone if date_time.tzinfo is not None else None
```

```output
'I have scheduled a meeting with a sentient parrot to discuss research collaborations on October 3, 2023 at 2 pm Easter Time. Please let me know if you need to make any changes.'
```

```python
agent.run(
    "Can you tell me if I have any events on October 3, 2023 in Eastern Time, and if so, tell me if any of them are with a sentient parrot?"
)
```

```output
"Yes, you have an event on October 3, 2023 with a sentient parrot. The event is titled 'Meeting with sentient parrot' and is scheduled from 6:00 PM to 6:30 PM."
