title: Azure AI Services Toolkit
---

This toolkit is used to interact with the `Azure AI Services API` to achieve some multimodal capabilities.

Currently There are five tools bundled in this toolkit:

- **AzureAiServicesImageAnalysisTool**: used to extract caption, objects, tags, and text from images.
- **AzureAiServicesDocumentIntelligenceTool**: used to extract text, tables, and key-value pairs from documents.
- **AzureAiServicesSpeechToTextTool**: used to transcribe speech to text.
- **AzureAiServicesTextToSpeechTool**: used to synthesize text to speech.
- **AzureAiServicesTextAnalyticsForHealthTool**: used to extract healthcare entities.

First, you need to set up an Azure account and create an AI Services resource. You can follow the instructions [here](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-services/multi-service-resource) to create a resource.

Then, you need to get the endpoint, key and region of your resource, and set them as environment variables. You can find them in the "Keys and Endpoint" page of your resource.

```python
pip install -qU  azure-ai-formrecognizer > /dev/null
pip install -qU  azure-cognitiveservices-speech > /dev/null
pip install -qU  azure-ai-textanalytics > /dev/null
pip install -qU  azure-ai-vision-imageanalysis > /dev/null
pip install -qU langchain-community
```

```python
import os

os.environ["OPENAI_API_KEY"] = "sk-"
os.environ["AZURE_AI_SERVICES_KEY"] = ""
os.environ["AZURE_AI_SERVICES_ENDPOINT"] = ""
os.environ["AZURE_AI_SERVICES_REGION"] = ""
```

## Create the Toolkit

```python
from langchain_community.agent_toolkits import AzureAiServicesToolkit

toolkit = AzureAiServicesToolkit()
```

```python
[tool.name for tool in toolkit.get_tools()]
```

```output
['azure_ai_services_document_intelligence',
 'azure_ai_services_image_analysis',
 'azure_ai_services_speech_to_text',
 'azure_ai_services_text_to_speech',
 'azure_ai_services_text_analytics_for_health']
```

## Use within an Agent

```python
from langchain_classic import hub
from langchain.agents import AgentExecutor, create_structured_chat_agent
from langchain_openai import OpenAI
```

```python
llm = OpenAI(temperature=0)
tools = toolkit.get_tools()
prompt = hub.pull("hwchase17/structured-chat-agent")
agent = create_structured_chat_agent(llm, tools, prompt)

agent_executor = AgentExecutor(
    agent=agent, tools=tools, verbose=True, handle_parsing_errors=True
)
```

```python
agent_executor.invoke(
    {
        "input": "What can I make with these ingredients? "
        + "https://images.openai.com/blob/9ad5a2ab-041f-475f-ad6a-b51899c50182/ingredients.png"
    }
)
```

```output
