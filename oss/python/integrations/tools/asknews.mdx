> [AskNews](https://asknews.app) infuses any LLM with the latest global news (or historical news), using a single natural language query. Specifically, AskNews is enriching over 300k articles per day by translating, summarizing, extracting entities, and indexing them into hot and cold vector databases. AskNews puts these vector databases on a low-latency endpoint for you. When you query AskNews, you get back a prompt-optimized string that contains all the most pertinent enrichments (e.g. entities, classifications, translation, summarization). This means that you do not need to manage your own news RAG, and you do not need to worry about how to properly convey news information in a condensed way to your LLM.
> AskNews is also committed to transparency, which is why our coverage is monitored and diversified across hundreds of countries, 13 languages, and 50 thousand sources. If you'd like to track our source coverage, you can visit our [transparency dashboard](https://asknews.app/en/transparency).

## Setup

The integration lives in the `langchain-community` package. We also need to install the `asknews` package itself.

```bash
pip install -U langchain-community asknews
```

We also need to set our AskNews API credentials, which can be obtained at the [AskNews console](https://my.asknews.app).

```python
import getpass
import os

os.environ["ASKNEWS_CLIENT_ID"] = getpass.getpass()
os.environ["ASKNEWS_CLIENT_SECRET"] = getpass.getpass()
```

## Usage

Here we show how to use the tool individually.

```python
from langchain_community.tools.asknews import AskNewsSearch

tool = AskNewsSearch(max_results=2)
tool.invoke({"query": "Effect of fed policy on tech sector"})
```

```output
"\n<doc>\n[1]:\ntitle: Market Awaits Comments From Key Fed Official\nsummary: The market is awaiting comments from Fed Governor Christopher Waller, but it's not expected to move markets significantly. The recent Consumer Price Index (CPI) report showed slimming inflation figures, leading to a conclusion that inflation is being curbed. This has led to a 'soft landing' narrative, causing bullish sentiment in the stock market, with the Dow, S&P 500, Nasdaq, and Russell 2000 indices near all-time highs. NVIDIA is set to report earnings next week, and despite its 95% year-to-date growth, it remains a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stock. The article also mentions upcoming economic data releases, including New and Existing Home Sales, S&P flash PMI Services and Manufacturing, Durable Goods, and Weekly Jobless Claims.\nsource: Yahoo\npublished: May 17 2024 14:53\nOrganization: Nasdaq, Fed, NVIDIA, Zacks\nPerson: Christopher Waller\nEvent: Weekly Jobless Claims\nclassification: Business\nsentiment: 0\n</doc>\n\n<doc>\n[2]:\ntitle: US futures flat as Fed comments cool rate cut optimism\nsummary: US stock index futures remained flat on Thursday evening, following a weak finish on Wall Street, as Federal Reserve officials warned that bets on interest rate cuts were potentially premature. The Fed officials, including Atlanta Fed President Raphael Bostic, New York Fed President John Williams, and Cleveland Fed President Loretta Mester, stated that the central bank still needed more confidence to cut interest rates, and that the timing of the move remained uncertain. As a result, investors slightly trimmed their expectations for a September rate cut, and the S&P 500 and Nasdaq 100 indexes fell 0.2% and 0.3%, respectively. Meanwhile, Reddit surged 11% after announcing a partnership with OpenAI, while Take-Two Interactive and DXC Technology fell after issuing disappointing earnings guidance.\nsource: Yahoo\npublished: May 16 2024 20:08\nLocation: US, Wall Street\nDate: September, Thursday\nOrganization: Atlanta Fed, Cleveland Fed, New York Fed, Fed, Reddit, Take-Two Interactive, DXC Technology, OpenAI, Federal Reserve\nTitle: President\nPerson: Loretta Mester, Raphael Bostic, John Williams\nclassification: Business\nsentiment: 0\n</doc>\n"

## Chaining

We show here how to use it as part of an agent. We use the OpenAI Functions Agent, so we will need to setup and install the required dependencies for that. We will also use [LangSmith Hub](https://smith.langchain.com/hub) to pull the prompt from, so we will need to install that.

```bash
pip install -U langchain-openai langchainhub
```

```python
import getpass
import os

os.environ["OPENAI_API_KEY"] = getpass.getpass()
```

```python
from langchain_classic import hub
from langchain.agents import AgentExecutor, create_openai_functions_agent
from langchain_community.tools.asknews import AskNewsSearch
from langchain_openai import ChatOpenAI

prompt = hub.pull("hwchase17/openai-functions-agent")
llm = ChatOpenAI(temperature=0)
asknews_tool = AskNewsSearch()
tools = [asknews_tool]
agent = create_openai_functions_agent(llm, tools, prompt)
agent_executor = AgentExecutor(agent=agent, tools=tools)
agent_executor.invoke({"input": "How is the tech sector being affected by fed policy?"})
```

```output
{'input': 'How is the tech sector being affected by fed policy?',
 'output': 'The tech sector is being affected by federal policy in various ways, particularly in relation to artificial intelligence (AI) regulation and investment. Here are some recent news articles related to the tech sector and federal policy:\n\n1. The US Senate has released a bipartisan AI policy roadmap, addressing areas of consensus and disagreement on AI use and development. The roadmap includes recommendations for intellectual property reforms, funding for AI research, sector-specific rules, and transparency requirements. It also emphasizes the need for increased funding for AI innovation and investments in national defense. [Source: The National Law Review]\n\n2. A bipartisan group of US senators, led by Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, has proposed allocating at least $32 billion over the next three years to develop AI and establish safeguards around it. The proposal aims to regulate and promote AI development to maintain US competitiveness and improve quality of life. [Source: Cointelegraph]\n\n3. The US administration is planning to restrict the export of advanced AI models to prevent China and Russia from accessing the technology. This move is part of efforts to protect national security and prevent the misuse of AI by foreign powers. [Source: O Cafezinho]\n\n4. The US and China have discussed the risks of AI technologies, with the US taking the lead in the AI arms race. The US has proposed a $32 billion increase in federal spending on AI to maintain its lead, despite concerns about stifling innovation. [Source: AOL]\n\nThese articles highlight the ongoing discussions and actions related to AI regulation, investment, and export restrictions that are impacting the tech sector in response to federal policy decisions.'}
