title: LinkupSearchTool
---

> [Linkup](https://www.linkup.so/) provides an API to connect LLMs to the web and the Linkup Premium Partner sources.

This guide provides a quick overview for getting started with LinkupSearchTool [tool](/oss/python/langchain/tools). For detailed documentation of all LinkupSearchTool features and configurations head to the [API reference](https://python.langchain.com/api_reference/linkup/tools/linkup_langchain.search_tool.LinkupSearchTool.html).

## Overview

### Integration details

| Class | Package | Serializable | [JS support](https://js.langchain.com/docs/integrations/tools/linkup_search) |  Version |
| :--- | :--- | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| [LinkupSearchTool](https://python.langchain.com/api_reference/linkup/tools/linkup_langchain.search_tool.LinkupSearchTool.html) | [langchain-linkup](https://python.langchain.com/api_reference/linkup/index.html) | ❌ | ❌ |  ![PyPI - Version](https://img.shields.io/pypi/v/langchain-linkup?style=flat-square&label=%20) |

## Setup

To use the Linkup provider, you need a valid API key, which you can find by signing-up [here](https://app.linkup.so/sign-up). To run the following examples you will also need an OpenAI API key.

### Installation

This tool lives in the `langchain-linkup` package:

```python
pip install -qU langchain-linkup
```

### Credentials

```python
import getpass
import os

# if not os.environ.get("LINKUP_API_KEY"):
#     os.environ["LINKUP_API_KEY"] = getpass.getpass("LINKUP API key:\n")
```

It's also helpful (but not needed) to set up [LangSmith](https://smith.langchain.com/) for best-in-class observability:

```python
os.environ["LANGSMITH_TRACING"] = "true"
# os.environ["LANGSMITH_API_KEY"] = getpass.getpass()
```

## Instantiation

Here we show how to instantiate an instance of the LinkupSearchTool tool, with

```python
from langchain_linkup import LinkupSearchTool

tool = LinkupSearchTool(
    depth="deep",  # "standard" or "deep"
    output_type="searchResults",  # "searchResults", "sourcedAnswer" or "structured"
    linkup_api_key=None,  # API key can be passed here or set as the LINKUP_API_KEY environment variable
)
```

## Invocation

### Invoke directly with args

The tool simply accepts a `query`, which is a string.

```python
tool.invoke({"query": "Who won the latest US presidential elections?"})
```

```output

### Invoke with ToolCall

We can also invoke the tool with a model-generated ToolCall, in which case a ToolMessage will be returned:

```python
# This is usually generated by a model, but we'll create a tool call directly for demo purposes.
model_generated_tool_call = {
    "args": {"query": "Who won the latest US presidential elections?"},
    "id": "1",
    "name": tool.name,
    "type": "tool_call",
}
tool.invoke(model_generated_tool_call)
```

## Chaining

We can use our tool in a chain by first binding it to a [tool-calling model](/oss/python/langchain/tools/) and then calling it:

<ChatModelTabs customVarName="llm" />

```python
# | output: false
# | echo: false

# !pip install -qU langchain langchain-openai
from langchain.chat_models import init_chat_model

model = init_chat_model(model="gpt-4o", model_provider="openai")
```

```python
from langchain_core.prompts import ChatPromptTemplate
from langchain_core.runnables import RunnableConfig, chain

prompt = ChatPromptTemplate(
    [
        ("system", "You are a helpful assistant."),
        ("human", "{user_input}"),
        ("placeholder", "{messages}"),
    ]
)

# specifying tool_choice will force the model to call this tool.
model_with_tools = model.bind_tools([tool], tool_choice=tool.name)

model_chain = prompt | model_with_tools


@chain
def tool_chain(user_input: str, config: RunnableConfig):
    input_ = {"user_input": user_input}
    ai_msg = model_chain.invoke(input_, config=config)
    tool_msgs = tool.batch(ai_msg.tool_calls, config=config)
    return model_chain.invoke({**input_, "messages": [ai_msg, *tool_msgs]}, config=config)


tool_chain.invoke("Who won the 2016 US presidential elections?")
```

```output
