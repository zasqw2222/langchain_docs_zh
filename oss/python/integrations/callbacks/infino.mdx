title: Infino
---

>[Infino](https://github.com/infinohq/infino) is a scalable telemetry store designed for logs, metrics, and traces. Infino can function as a standalone observability solution or as the storage layer in your observability stack.

This example shows how one can track the following while calling OpenAI and ChatOpenAI models via `LangChain` and [Infino](https://github.com/infinohq/infino):

* prompt input
* response from `ChatGPT` or any other `LangChain` model
* latency
* errors
* number of tokens consumed

## Initializing

```python
# Install necessary dependencies.
pip install -qU  infinopy
pip install -qU  matplotlib
pip install -qU  tiktoken
pip install -qU  langchain langchain-openai langchain-community
pip install -qU  beautifulsoup4
```

```python
from langchain_community.callbacks.infino_callback import InfinoCallbackHandler
```

```python
import datetime as dt
import json
import time

import matplotlib.dates as md
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from infinopy import InfinoClient
from langchain_openai import OpenAI
```

## Start Infino server, initialize the Infino client

```python
# Start server using the Infino docker image.
!docker run --rm --detach --name infino-example -p 3000:3000 infinohq/infino:latest

# Create Infino client.
client = InfinoClient()
```

```output
a1159e99c6bdb3101139157acee6aba7ae9319375e77ab6fbc79beff75abeca3
```

## Read the questions dataset

```python
# These are a subset of questions from Stanford's QA dataset -
# https://rajpurkar.github.io/SQuAD-explorer/
data = """In what country is Normandy located?
When were the Normans in Normandy?
From which countries did the Norse originate?
Who was the Norse leader?
What century did the Normans first gain their separate identity?
Who gave their name to Normandy in the 1000's and 1100's
What is France a region of?
Who did King Charles III swear fealty to?
When did the Frankish identity emerge?
Who was the duke in the battle of Hastings?
Who ruled the duchy of Normandy
What religion were the Normans
What type of major impact did the Norman dynasty have on modern Europe?
Who was famed for their Christian spirit?
Who assimilted the Roman language?
Who ruled the country of Normandy?
What principality did William the conqueror found?
What is the original meaning of the word Norman?
When was the Latin version of the word Norman first recorded?
What name comes from the English words Normans/Normanz?"""

questions = data.split("\n")
```

## Example 1: LangChain OpenAI Q&A; Publish metrics and logs to Infino

```python
# Set your key here.
# os.environ["OPENAI_API_KEY"] = "YOUR_API_KEY"

# Create callback handler. This logs latency, errors, token usage, prompts as well as prompt responses to Infino.
handler = InfinoCallbackHandler(
    model_id="test_openai", model_version="0.1", verbose=False
)

# Create LLM.
llm = OpenAI(temperature=0.1)

# Number of questions to ask the OpenAI model. We limit to a short number here to save $$ while running this demo.
num_questions = 10

questions = questions[0:num_questions]
for question in questions:
    print(question)

    # We send the question to OpenAI API, with Infino callback.
    llm_result = llm.generate([question], callbacks=[handler])
    print(llm_result)
```

## Create Metric Charts

We now use matplotlib to create graphs of latency, errors and tokens consumed.

```python
# Helper function to create a graph using matplotlib.
def plot(data, title):
    data = json.loads(data)

    # Extract x and y values from the data
    timestamps = [item["time"] for item in data]
    dates = [dt.datetime.fromtimestamp(ts) for ts in timestamps]
    y = [item["value"] for item in data]

    plt.rcParams["figure.figsize"] = [6, 4]
    plt.subplots_adjust(bottom=0.2)
    plt.xticks(rotation=25)
    ax = plt.gca()
    xfmt = md.DateFormatter("%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S")
    ax.xaxis.set_major_formatter(xfmt)

    # Create the plot
    plt.plot(dates, y)

    # Set labels and title
    plt.xlabel("Time")
    plt.ylabel("Value")
    plt.title(title)

    plt.show()
```

```python
response = client.search_ts("__name__", "latency", 0, int(time.time()))
plot(response.text, "Latency")

response = client.search_ts("__name__", "error", 0, int(time.time()))
plot(response.text, "Errors")

response = client.search_ts("__name__", "prompt_tokens", 0, int(time.time()))
plot(response.text, "Prompt Tokens")

response = client.search_ts("__name__", "completion_tokens", 0, int(time.time()))
plot(response.text, "Completion Tokens")

response = client.search_ts("__name__", "total_tokens", 0, int(time.time()))
plot(response.text, "Total Tokens")
```

## Full text query on prompt or prompt outputs

```python
# Search for a particular prompt text.
query = "normandy"
response = client.search_log(query, 0, int(time.time()))
print("Results for", query, ":", response.text)

print("===")

query = "king charles III"
response = client.search_log("king charles III", 0, int(time.time()))
print("Results for", query, ":", response.text)
```

```output
Results for normandy : [{"time":1696947743,"fields":{"prompt_response":"\n\nThe Normans, a people from northern France, gave their name to Normandy in the 1000s and 1100s.

===
Results for king charles III : [{"time":1696947745,"fields":{"prompt_response":"\n\nKing Charles III swore fealty to King Philip II of Spain."},"text":"\n\nKing Charles III swore fealty to King Philip II of Spain."},{"time":1696947744,"fields":{"prompt":"Who did King Charles III swear fealty to?"},"text":"Who did King Charles III swear fealty to?"}]

# Example 2: Summarize a piece of text using ChatOpenAI

from langchain_community.document_loaders import WebBaseLoader
from langchain_openai import ChatOpenAI

# Create callback handler. This logs latency, errors, token usage, prompts, as well as prompt responses to Infino.

    model_id="test_chatopenai", model_version="0.1", verbose=False
)

]

for url in urls:
    loader = WebBaseLoader(url)
    docs = loader.load()

    llm = ChatOpenAI(temperature=0, model_name="gpt-3.5-turbo-16k", callbacks=[handler])
    chain = load_summarize_chain(llm, chain_type="stuff", verbose=False)

## Create Metric Charts

```python

plot(response.text, "Prompt Tokens")

response = client.search_ts("__name__", "completion_tokens", 0, int(time.time()))
plot(response.text, "Completion Tokens")
```

```python
## Full text query on prompt or prompt outputs
```

```python
# Search for a particular prompt text.
query = "machine learning"
response = client.search_log(query, 0, int(time.time()))

# The output can be verbose - uncomment below if it needs to be printed.
# print("Results for", query, ":", response.text)

print("===")
```

```output

```

```python
## Stop Infino server
```

```python
!docker rm -f infino-example

```output
