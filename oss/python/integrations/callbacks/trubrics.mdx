>[Trubrics](https://trubrics.com) is an LLM user analytics platform that lets you collect, analyse and manage user
prompts & feedback on AI models.

>Check out [Trubrics repo](https://github.com/trubrics/trubrics-sdk) for more information on `Trubrics`.

In this guide, we will go over how to set up the `TrubricsCallbackHandler`.

## Installation and Setup

```python
pip install -qU  trubrics langchain langchain-community
```

### Getting Trubrics Credentials

If you do not have a Trubrics account, create one on [here](https://trubrics.streamlit.app/). In this tutorial, we will use the `default` project that is built upon account creation.

Now set your credentials as environment variables:

```python
import os

os.environ["TRUBRICS_EMAIL"] = "***@***"
os.environ["TRUBRICS_PASSWORD"] = "***"
```

```python
from langchain_community.callbacks.trubrics_callback import TrubricsCallbackHandler
```

### Usage

The `TrubricsCallbackHandler` can receive various optional arguments. See [here](https://trubrics.github.io/trubrics-sdk/platform/user_prompts/#saving-prompts-to-trubrics) for kwargs that can be passed to Trubrics prompts.

```python
class TrubricsCallbackHandler(BaseCallbackHandler):

    """
    Callback handler for Trubrics.

    Args:
        project: a trubrics project, default project is "default"
        email: a trubrics account email, can equally be set in env variables
        password: a trubrics account password, can equally be set in env variables
        **kwargs: all other kwargs are parsed and set to trubrics prompt variables, or added to the `metadata` dict
    """
```

## Examples

Here are two examples of how to use the `TrubricsCallbackHandler` with LangChain [LLMs](/oss/python/langchain/models) or [Chat Models](/oss/python/langchain/models). We will use OpenAI models, so set your `OPENAI_API_KEY` key here:

```python
os.environ["OPENAI_API_KEY"] = "sk-***"
```

### 1. With an LLM

```python
from langchain_openai import OpenAI
```

```python
llm = OpenAI(callbacks=[TrubricsCallbackHandler()])
```

```output
2023-09-26 11:30:02.149 | INFO     | trubrics.platform.auth:get_trubrics_auth_token:61 - User jeff.kayne@trubrics.com has been authenticated.
```

```python
res = llm.generate(["Tell me a joke", "Write me a poem"])
```

```output
2023-09-26 11:30:07.760 | INFO     | trubrics.platform:log_prompt:102 - User prompt saved to Trubrics.
2023-09-26 11:30:08.042 | INFO     | trubrics.platform:log_prompt:102 - User prompt saved to Trubrics.
```

```python
print("--> GPT's joke: ", res.generations[0][0].text)
print()
print("--> GPT's poem: ", res.generations[1][0].text)
```

```output
--> GPT's joke:

Q: What did the fish say when it hit the wall?
A: Dam!

--> GPT's poem:

A Poem of Reflection

I stand here in the night,
The stars above me filling my sight.
I feel such a deep connection,
To the world and all its perfection.

A moment of clarity,
The calmness in the air so serene.
My mind is filled with peace,
And I am released.

The past and the present,
My thoughts create a pleasant sentiment.
My heart is full of joy,
My soul soars like a toy.

I reflect on my life,
And the choices I have made.
My struggles and my strife,
The lessons I have paid.

The future is a mystery,
But I am ready to take the leap.
I am ready to take the lead,
And to create my own destiny.
```

### 2. With a chat model

```python
from langchain.messages import HumanMessage, SystemMessage
from langchain_openai import ChatOpenAI
```

```python
chat_llm = ChatOpenAI(
    callbacks=[
        TrubricsCallbackHandler(
            project="default",
            tags=["chat model"],
            user_id="user-id-1234",
            some_metadata={"hello": [1, 2]},
        )
    ]
)
```

```python
chat_res = chat_llm.invoke(
    [
        SystemMessage(content="Every answer of yours must be about OpenAI."),
        HumanMessage(content="Tell me a joke"),
    ]
)
```

```output
2023-09-26 11:30:10.550 | INFO     | trubrics.platform:log_prompt:102 - User prompt saved to Trubrics.
```

```python
print(chat_res.content)
```

```output
Why did the OpenAI computer go to the party?

Because it wanted to meet its AI friends and have a byte of fun!
```

```python

```
