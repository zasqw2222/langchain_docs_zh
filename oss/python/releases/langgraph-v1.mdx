sidebarTitle: Release notes
---

**LangGraph v1 is a stability-focused release for the agent runtime.** It keeps the core graph APIs and execution model unchanged, while refining type safety, docs, and developer ergonomics.

It's designed to work hand-in-hand with [LangChain v1](/oss/python/releases/langchain-v1) (whose `create_agent` is built on LangGraph) so you can start high-level and drop down to granular control when needed.

        Graph primitives (state, nodes, edges) and the execution/runtime model are unchanged, making upgrades straightforward.

    <Card title="Reliability, by default" icon="database">
        Durable execution with checkpointing, persistence, streaming, and human-in-the-loop continues to be first-class.

    <Card title="Seamless with LangChain v1" icon="link">
        LangChain's `create_agent` runs on LangGraph. Use LangChain for a fast start; drop to LangGraph for custom orchestration.

## Deprecation of `create_react_agent`

The LangGraph [`create_react_agent`](https://reference.langchain.com/python/langgraph/agents/#langgraph.prebuilt.chat_agent_executor.create_react_agent) prebuilt has been deprecated in favor of LangChain's [`create_agent`](https://reference.langchain.com/python/langchain/agents/#langchain.agents.create_agent). It provides a simpler interface, and offers greater customization potential through the introduction of middleware.

* For information on the new [`create_agent`](https://reference.langchain.com/python/langchain/agents/#langchain.agents.create_agent) API, see the [LangChain v1 release notes](/oss/python/releases/langchain-v1#create-agent).
* For information on migrating from [`create_react_agent`](https://reference.langchain.com/python/langgraph/agents/#langgraph.prebuilt.chat_agent_executor.create_react_agent) to [`create_agent`](https://reference.langchain.com/python/langchain/agents/#langchain.agents.create_agent), see the [LangChain v1 migration guide](/oss/python/migrate/langchain-v1#create-agent).
