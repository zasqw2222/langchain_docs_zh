title: MODEL_NOT_FOUND
---

<Note>
    Currently only used in `langchainjs` (JavaScript/TypeScript).
</Note>

The model name you have specified is not acknowledged by your provider.

## Troubleshooting

To resolve this error:

1. **Verify the model identifier**: Double check the model string you are passing in. Ensure the spelling and format are correct
2. **Check proxy/wrapper configurations**: If you are using a proxy or other alternative host with a model wrapper, confirm that the permitted model names are not restricted or altered

The error typically stems from either a typo in the model name string itself or restrictions imposed by a proxy service or model wrapper between your code and the provider's API.
