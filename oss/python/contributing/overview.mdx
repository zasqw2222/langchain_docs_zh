## Ways to Contribute

<AccordionGroup>
    <Accordion title="Report bugs" icon="bug">
        Found a bug? Please help us fix it by following these steps:

        <Steps>
            <Step title="Search">
                Check if the issue already exists in our GitHub Issues for the respective repo:

                <Columns cols={2}>
                    <Card title="LangChain" icon="link" href="https://github.com/langchain-ai/langchain/issues">Issues</Card>
                    <Card title="LangGraph" icon="circle-nodes" href="https://github.com/langchain-ai/langgraph/issues">Issues</Card>
                </Columns>


            </Step>
            <Step title="Create issue">
                If no issue exists, create a new one. When writing, be sure to follow the template provided and to include a [minimal, reproducible, example](https://stackoverflow.com/help/minimal-reproducible-example). Attach any relevant labels to the final issue once created. If a project maintainer is unable to reproduce the issue, it is unlikely to be addressed in a timely manner.
            </Step>
            <Step title="Wait">
                A project maintainer will triage the issue and may ask for additional information. Please be patient as we manage a high volume of issues. Do not bump the issue unless you have new information to provide.
            </Step>
        </Steps>

        If you are adding an issue, please try to keep it focused on a single topic. If two issues are related, or blocking, please [link them](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/tracking-your-work-with-issues/using-issues/linking-a-pull-request-to-an-issue#linking-a-pull-request-to-an-issue-using-a-keyword) rather than combining them. For example,

        ```text
        This issue is blocked by #123 and related to #456.
        ```
    </Accordion>

    <Accordion title="Suggest features" icon="wand-magic-sparkles">
        Have an idea for a new feature or enhancement?

        <Steps>
            <Step title="Search">
                Search the issues for the respective repository for existing feature requests:

                <Columns cols={2}>
                    <Card title="LangChain" icon="link" href="https://github.com/langchain-ai/langchain/issues?q=state%3Aopen%20label%3A%22feature%20request%22">Issues</Card>
                    <Card title="LangGraph" icon="circle-nodes" href="https://github.com/langchain-ai/langgraph/issues?q=state%3Aopen%20label%3Aenhancement">Issues</Card>
                </Columns>


            </Step>
            <Step title="Discuss">
                If no requests exist, start a new discussion under the [relevant category](https://forum.langchain.com/c/help/langchain/14) so that project maintainers and the community can provide feedback.


            </Step>
            <Step title="Describe">
                Be sure to describe the use case and why it would be valuable to others. If possible, provide examples or mockups where applicable. Outline test cases that should pass.
            </Step>
        </Steps>
    </Accordion>

    <Accordion title="Improve documentation" icon="book">
        Documentation improvements are always welcome! We strive to keep our docs clear and comprehensive, and your perspective can make a big difference.

        <Card title="How to propose changes to the documentation" href="/oss/python/contributing/documentation" arrow>Guide</Card>
    </Accordion>

    <Accordion title="Contribute code" icon="code">
        With a large userbase, it can be hard for our small team to keep up with all the feature requests and bug fixes. If you have the skills and time, we would love your help!

        <Card title="How to make your first Pull Request" href="/oss/python/contributing/code" arrow>Guide</Card>

        If you start working on an issue, please assign it to yourself or ask a maintainer to do so. This helps avoid duplicate work.

        If you are looking for something to work on, check out the issues labeled "good first issue" or "help wanted" in our repos:

        <Columns cols={2}>
            <Card title="LangChain" icon="link" href="https://github.com/langchain-ai/langchain/labels">Labels</Card>
            <Card title="LangGraph" icon="circle-nodes" href="https://github.com/langchain-ai/langgraph/labels">Labels</Card>
        </Columns>

    <Accordion title="Add a new integration" icon="plug-circle-plus">
        {/* <Columns cols={2}>
