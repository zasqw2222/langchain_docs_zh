This page provides a comprehensive reference table of [workspace](/langsmith/administration-overview#workspaces) and [organization](/langsmith/administration-overview#organizations) operations and which roles can perform them.

The list includes API operations in LangSmith along with:

- Which system roles can perform each operation.
- The specific permission string required.
- Notes about partial access or special cases.

<Info>
For an overview of LangSmith's RBAC system, role definitions, and permission concepts, refer to [Role-based access control](/langsmith/rbac).

## User-level operations

These operations are available to all authenticated users and don't require specific workspace or organization permissions:

- View own user profile
- Update own user profile
- List organizations for user
- Create new organization
- List pending workspace invites
- Delete pending workspace invite
- Claim pending workspace invite
- List pending organization invites
- Delete pending organization invite
- Claim pending organization invite

## Permission inheritance

### Organization to workspace

- [Organization Admin](/langsmith/rbac#organization-admin) automatically has full permissions in all workspaces.
- [Organization User](/langsmith/rbac#organization-user) and [Organization Viewer](/langsmith/rbac#organization-viewer) only get workspace access when explicitly added to workspaces with workspace-level roles.

For detailed role definitions, refer to [Organization roles](/langsmith/rbac#organization-roles) and [Workspace roles](/langsmith/rbac#workspace-roles).

### Workspace role independence

- Users can have different workspace roles in different workspaces.
- A user might be a [Workspace Admin](/langsmith/rbac#workspace-admin) in one workspace and a [Workspace Viewer](/langsmith/rbac#workspace-viewer) in another.
