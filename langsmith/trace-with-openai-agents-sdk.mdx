The OpenAI Agents SDK allows you to build agentic applications powered by OpenAI's models.

Learn how to trace your LLM applications using the OpenAI Agents SDK with LangSmith.

## Installation

<Info>
Requires Python SDK version `langsmith>=0.3.15`.
</Info>

Install LangSmith with OpenAI Agents support:

<CodeGroup>
```bash pip
pip install "langsmith[openai-agents]"
```

```bash uv
uv add "langsmith[openai-agents]"
```
</CodeGroup>

This will install both the LangSmith library and the OpenAI Agents SDK.

## Quick Start

You can integrate LangSmith tracing with the OpenAI Agents SDK by using the `OpenAIAgentsTracingProcessor` class.

```python
import asyncio
from agents import Agent, Runner, set_trace_processors
from langsmith.integrations.openai_agents_sdk import OpenAIAgentsTracingProcessor

async def main():
    agent = Agent(
        name="Captain Obvious",
        instructions="You are Captain Obvious, the world's most literal technical support agent.",
    )

    question = "Why is my code failing when I try to divide by zero? I keep getting this error message."
    result = await Runner.run(agent, question)
    print(result.final_output)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    set_trace_processors([OpenAIAgentsTracingProcessor()])
    asyncio.run(main())
```

The agent's execution flow, including all spans and their details, will be logged to LangSmith.
