## Set up billing for your account

<Note>
Before using this guide, note the following:

- If you are interested in the [Enterprise](https://www.langchain.com/pricing) plan, please [contact sales](https://www.langchain.com/contact-sales). This guide is only for our self-serve billing plans.
</Note>

To set up billing for your LangSmith organization, navigate to the [Billing and Usage](https://smith.langchain.com/settings/payments) page under **Settings**. Depending on your organization's settings, there are different setup guides:

- [Developer plan](#developer-plan%3A-set-up-billing-on-your-personal-organization)
- [Plus plan](#plus-plan%3A-set-up-billing-on-a-shared-organization)

### Developer Plan: set up billing on your personal organization

Personal organizations are limited to 5,000 traces per month until a credit card is added. To add a card:

1. Click **Add card to remove trace limit**.
1. Add your credit card information.
1. Once complete, you will no longer be rate limited to 5,000 traces, and you will be charged for any excess traces at rates specified on the [pricing](https://www.langchain.com/pricing-langsmith) page.

### Plus Plan: set up billing on a shared organization
Team organizations are given an initial 10,000 traces per month. Any excess traces will be charged at rates specified on the [pricing](https://www.langchain.com/pricing-langsmith) page.

<Note>
New organizations that you manually create are required to be on the Plus Plan. If you see a message about needing to upgrade to Plus to use this organization, follow these steps.
</Note>

1. Click **Upgrade to Plus**.
1. Invite members to your organization, as desired.
1. Enter your credit card information. Then, enter business information, invoice email, and tax ID. If this organization belongs to a business, check the **This is a business** checkbox and enter the information accordingly. For more information, refer to the [Update your information section](#update-your-information).

## Update your information (Paid plans only)

To update business information for your LangSmith organization, head to the [Billing and Usage](https://smith.langchain.com/settings/payments) page under **Settings**.


### Invoice email

To update the email address for invoices, follow these steps:

1. Navigate to the **Plans and Billing** tab.
2. Locate the section beneath the payment method, where the current invoice email is displayed.
3. Enter the new email address for invoices in the provided field.
4. The new email address will be automatically saved.

You will receive all future invoices to the updated email address.

### Business information and tax ID

<Note>
In certain jurisdictions, LangSmith is required to collect sales tax. If you are a business, providing your tax ID may qualify you for a sales tax exemption.
</Note>

To update your organization's business information, follow these steps:

1. Navigate to the **Plans and Billing** tab.
2. Below the invoice email section, you will find a checkbox labeled **Business**.
3. Check the **Business** checkbox if your organization belongs to a business.
4. A business information section will appear, allowing you to enter or update the following details:
   - Business Name
   - Address
   - Tax ID for applicable jurisdictions
5. A Tax ID field will appear for applicable jurisdictions after you select a country.
6. After entering the necessary information, click the **Save** button to save your changes.

This ensures that your business information is up-to-date and accurate for billing and tax purposes.

## Enforce spend limits

<Check>
You may find it helpful to read the following pages, before continuing with this section on optimizing your tracing spend:

- [Data Retention Conceptual Docs](/langsmith/administration-overview#data-retention)
- [Usage Limiting Conceptual Docs](/langsmith/administration-overview#usage-limits)
</Check>

<Note>
Some of the features mentioned in this guide are not currently available on Enterprise plan due to its custom nature of billing. If you are on the Enterprise plan and have questions about cost optimization, reach out to your sales rep or [support@langchain.dev](mailto:support@langchain.dev).
</Note>


### Understand your current usage

The first step of any optimization process is to understand current usage. LangSmith provides two ways to do this: [Usage graph](#usage-graph) and [Invoices](#invoices).

LangSmith Usage is measured per workspace, because workspaces often represent development environments (as in the example), or teams within an organization.


#### Usage graph

The usage graph lets you examine how much of each usage-based pricing metric you have consumed. It does not directly show spend (which you will review later in the draft invoice).

Navigate to the usage graph under **Settings** -> **Billing and Usage** -> **Usage Graph**.

There are two usage metrics that LangSmith charges for:

- LangSmith Traces (Base Charge): tracks all traces that you send to LangSmith.
- LangSmith Traces (Extended Data Retention Upgrades): tracks all traces that also have our Extended 400 Day Data Retention.

For more details, refer to the [data retention conceptual docs](/langsmith/administration-overview#data-retention).


#### Invoices

To understand how your usage translates to spend, navigate to the **Invoices** tab. The first invoice that will appear on screen is a draft of your current month's invoice, which shows your running spend thus far this month.

<Note>
LangSmith's Usage Graph and Invoice use the term `tenant_id` to refer to a workspace ID. They are interchangeable.
</Note>

### Set limits on usage

![](/langsmith/images/p2usagelimitsempty-v2.png)

#### Set spend limit for workspace

1. To set limits, navigate to **Settings** -> **Billing and Usage** -> **Usage limits**.
1. Input a spend limit for your selected workspace. LangSmith will determine an appropriate number of base and extended trace limits to match that spend. The trace limits include the free trace allocation that comes with your plan \(see details on [pricing page](https://smith.langchain.com/settings/payments)\).


<Note>
For organizations with **multiple workspaces only**: For simplicity, LangSmith incorporates the free traces into the cost calculation of the **first workspace only**. In actuality, the free traces can be "consumed" by any workspace. Therefore, although workspace-level spend limits are approximate for multi-workspace organizations, the organization-level spend limit is absolute.
</Note>

#### Configure trace tier distrubution
LangSmith has two trace tiers: base traces and extended traces. Base traces have the base retention and are short-lived (14 days), while extended traces have extended retention and are long-lived (400 days). For more information, refer to the [data retention conceptual docs](/langsmith/administration-overview#data-retention).

Set the desired default trace tier by selecting an option below the **Default data retention** label. All traces will have this tier by default when they are registered. Note that because extended traces cost more than base traces, selecting **Extended** as your default data retention option will result in less overall traces allowed in the billing period. By default, updating this setting will only apply to future incoming traces. To apply to all existing traces in the workspace, select the checkbox.

If the default data retention is set to **Base** you can optionally use the slider to distribute trace limits across base and extended tracess. LangSmith automatically provides a suggestion for this distribution but you can tailor this to your needs. For example, if you are running lots of automations or other features that may upgrade a trace to extended, you may want to increase your extended trace limits. To see the complete list of features that may upgrade a trace, [see here](https://docs.langchain.com/langsmith/administration-overview#how-it-works:~:text=Data%20retention%20auto%2Dupgrades).


<Note>
The extended data retention limit can cause features other than tracing to stop working once reached. If you plan to use this feature, read more about its [functionality and side effects](/langsmith/administration-overview#side-effects-of-extended-data-retention-traces-limit).
</Note>

### Other methods of managing traces

#### Change project-level default retention

Data retention settings are adjustable per tracing project.

Navigate to **Projects** > ***Your project name*** > Select **Retention** and select the desired default retention. This will only affect retention (and pricing) for **traces going forward**.

![](/langsmith/images/p1projectretention.png)

#### Apply extended data retention to a percentage of traces

You may not want all traces to expire after 14 days. You can automatically extend the retention of traces that match some criteria by creating an [automation rule](/langsmith/rules). You might want to apply extended data retention to specific types of traces, such as:

* 10% of all traces: For general analysis or analyzing trends long term.
* Errored traces: To investigate and debug issues thoroughly.
* Traces with specific metadata: For long-term examination of particular features or user flows.

To configure this:

1. Navigate to **Projects** > ***Your project name*** > Select **+ New** > Select **New Automation**.
2. Name your rule and optionally apply filters or a sample rate. For more information on configuring filters, refer to [filtering techniques](/langsmith/filter-traces-in-application#filter-operators).

<Note>
When an automation rule matches any [run](/langsmith/observability-concepts#runs) within a [trace](/langsmith/observability-concepts#traces), then all runs within the trace are upgraded to be retained for 400 days.
</Note>

For example, this is the expected configuration to keep 10% of all traces for extended data retention:

![](/langsmith/images/P2SampleTraces.png)

If you want to keep a subset of traces for **longer than 400 days** for data collection purposes, you can create another run rule that sends some runs to a dataset of your choosing. A dataset allows you to store the trace inputs and outputs (e.g., as a key-value dataset), and will persist indefinitely, even after the trace gets deleted.
