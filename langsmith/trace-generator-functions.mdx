In most LLM applications, you will want to stream outputs to minimize the time to the first token seen by the user.

LangSmith's tracing functionality natively supports streamed outputs via `generator` functions. Below is an example.

<CodeGroup>

```python Python
from langsmith import traceable
@traceable
def my_generator():
  for chunk in ["Hello", "World", "!"]:
      yield chunk
# Stream to the user
for output in my_generator():
  print(output)
# It also works with async functions
import asyncio
@traceable
async def my_async_generator():
  for chunk in ["Hello", "World", "!"]:
      yield chunk
# Stream to the user
async def main():
  async for output in my_async_generator():
      print(output)
asyncio.run(main())
```

```typescript TypeScript
import { traceable } from "langsmith/traceable";
const myGenerator = traceable(function* () {
  for (const chunk of ["Hello", "World", "!"]) {
      yield chunk;
  }
});
for (const output of myGenerator()) {
  console.log(output);
}
```

## Aggregate Results[](#aggregate-results "Direct link to Aggregate Results")

By default, the `outputs` of the traced function are aggregated into a single array in LangSmith. If you want to customize how it is stored (for instance, concatenating the outputs into a single string), you can use the `aggregate` option (`reduce_fn` in python). This is especially useful for aggregating streamed LLM outputs.

<Note>
Aggregating outputs **only** impacts the traced representation of the outputs. It doesn not alter the values returned by your function.
</Note>

<CodeGroup>

```python Python
from langsmith import traceable
def concatenate_strings(outputs: list):
  return "".join(outputs)
@traceable(reduce_fn=concatenate_strings)
def my_generator():
  for chunk in ["Hello", "World", "!"]:
      yield chunk
# Stream to the user
for output in my_generator():
  print(output)
# It also works with async functions
import asyncio
@traceable(reduce_fn=concatenate_strings)
async def my_async_generator():
  for chunk in ["Hello", "World", "!"]:
      yield chunk
# Stream to the user
async def main():
  async for output in my_async_generator():
      print(output)
asyncio.run(main())
```

```typescript TypeScript
import { traceable } from "langsmith/traceable";
const concatenateStrings = (outputs: string[]) => outputs.join("");
const myGenerator = traceable(function* () {
  for (const chunk of ["Hello", "World", "!"]) {
      yield chunk;
  }
}, { aggregator: concatenateStrings });
for (const output of await myGenerator()) {
  console.log(output);
}
```
