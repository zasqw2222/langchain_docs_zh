**LangSmith provides tools for developing, debugging, and deploying LLM applications.**
It helps you trace requests, evaluate outputs, test prompts, and manage deployments in one place.
LangSmith is framework agnostic, so you can use it with or without LangChain's open-source libraries
[`langchain`](/oss/python/langchain/overview) and [`langgraph`](/oss/python/langgraph/overview).
Prototype locally, then move to production with integrated monitoring and evaluation to build more reliable AI systems.

<Callout icon="bullhorn" color="#DFC5FE" iconType="regular">
LangGraph Platform is now [LangSmith Deployment](/langsmith/deployments). For more information, check out the [Changelog](https://changelog.langchain.com/announcements/product-naming-changes-langsmith-deployment-and-langsmith-studio).
