## Safari Connection Issues

Safari blocks plain-HTTP traffic on localhost. When running Studio with `langgraph dev`, you may see "Failed to load assistants" errors.

### Solution 1: Use Cloudflare Tunnel

<Tabs>
    <Tab title="Python">
    ```shell
    pip install -U langgraph-cli>=0.2.6
    langgraph dev --tunnel
    ```
    </Tab>
    <Tab title="JS">
    ```shell
    # Requires @langchain/langgraph-cli>=0.0.26
    npx @langchain/langgraph-cli dev --tunnel
    ```
    </Tab>
</Tabs>

The command outputs a URL in this format:

```shell
https://smith.langchain.com/studio/?baseUrl=https://hamilton-praise-heart-costumes.trycloudflare.com
```

Use this URL in Safari to load Studio. Here, the `baseUrl` parameter specifies your agent server endpoint.

### Solution 2: Use Chromium browser

Chrome and other Chromium browsers allow HTTP on localhost. Use `langgraph dev` without additional configuration.

## Brave Connection Issues

Brave blocks plain-HTTP traffic on localhost when Brave Shields are enabled. When running Studio with `langgraph dev`, you may see "Failed to load assistants" errors.

### Solution 1: Disable Brave Shields

Disable Brave Shields for LangSmith using the Brave icon in the URL bar.

### Solution 2: Use Cloudflare Tunnel

<Tabs>
    <Tab title="Python">
    ```shell
    pip install -U langgraph-cli>=0.2.6
    langgraph dev --tunnel
    ```
    </Tab>
    <Tab title="JS">
    ```shell
    # Requires @langchain/langgraph-cli>=0.0.26
    npx @langchain/langgraph-cli dev --tunnel
    ```
    </Tab>
</Tabs>

The command outputs a URL in this format:

```shell
https://smith.langchain.com/studio/?baseUrl=https://hamilton-praise-heart-costumes.trycloudflare.com
```

Use this URL in Brave to load Studio. Here, the `baseUrl` parameter specifies your agent server endpoint.

## Graph Edge Issues

Undefined conditional edges may show unexpected connections in your graph. This is
because without proper definition, Studio assumes the conditional edge could access all other nodes. To address this, explicitly define the routing paths using one of these methods:

### Solution 1: Path map

Define a mapping between router outputs and target nodes:

<Tabs>
    <Tab title="Python">
    ```python
    graph.add_conditional_edges("node_a", routing_function, {True: "node_b", False: "node_c"})
    ```
    </Tab>
    <Tab title="Javascript">
    ```ts
    graph.addConditionalEdges("node_a", routingFunction, { true: "node_b", false: "node_c" });
    ```
    </Tab>
</Tabs>

<a id="python"></a>
### Solution 2: Router type definition

Specify possible routing destinations using Python's `Literal` type:

```python
def routing_function(state: GraphState) -> Literal["node_b","node_c"]:
    if state['some_condition'] == True:
        return "node_b"
    else:
        return "node_c"
```

## Experiment troubleshooting in Studio

### **Run experiment** button is disabled

Check the following:

- **Deployed application**: If your application is deployed on LangSmith, you may need to create a new revision to enable this feature.
- **Local development server**: If you are running your application locally, make sure you have upgraded to the latest version of the `langgraph-cli` (`pip install -U langgraph-cli`). Additionally, ensure you have tracing enabled by setting the `LANGSMITH_API_KEY` in your project's `.env` file.

### Evaluator results are missing

When you run an experiment, any attached evaluators are scheduled for execution in a queue. If you don't see results immediately, it likely means they are still pending.
