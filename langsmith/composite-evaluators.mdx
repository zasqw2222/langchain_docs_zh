_Composite evaluators_ are a way to combine multiple evaluator scores into a single [score](/langsmith/evaluation-concepts#evaluator-outputs). This is useful when you want to evaluate multiple aspects of your application and combine the results into a single result.

## Create a composite evaluator using the UI

You can create composite evaluators on a [tracing project](/langsmith/observability-concepts#projects) (for [online evaluations](/langsmith/evaluation-concepts#online-evaluation)) or a [dataset](/langsmith/evaluation-concepts#datasets) (for [offline evaluations](/langsmith/evaluation-concepts#offline-evaluation)). With composite evaluators in the UI, you can compute a weighted average or weighted sum of multiple evaluator scores, with configurable weights.

### 1. Navigate to the tracing project or dataset

To start configuring a composite evaluator, navigate to the **Tracing Projects** or **Dataset & Experiments** tab and select a project or dataset.
- From within a tracing project: **+ New** > **Evaluator** > **Composite score**
- From within a dataset: **+ Evaluator** > **Composite score**

### 2. Configure the composite evaluator

1. Name your evaluator.
2. Select an aggregation method, either **Average** or **Sum**.
    - **Average**: ∑(weight*score) / ∑(weight).
    - **Sum**: ∑(weight*score).
3. Add the feedback keys you want to include in the composite score.
4. Add the weights for the feedback keys. By default, the weights are equal for each feedback key. Adjust the weights to increase or decrease the importance of specific feedback keys in the final score.
5. Click **Create** to save the evaluator.

<Tip> If you need to adjust the weights for the composite scores, they can be updated after the evaluator is created. The resulting scores will be updated for all runs that have the evaluator configured. </Tip>

### 3. View composite evaluator results
Composite scores are attached to a run as **feedback**, similarly to feedback from a single evaluator. How you can view them depends on where the evaluation was run:

**On a tracing project**:
- Composite scores appear as feedback on runs.
- [Filter for runs](/langsmith/filter-traces-in-application) with a composite score, or where the composite score meets a certain threshold.
- [Create a chart](/langsmith/dashboards#custom-dashboards) to visualize trends in the composite score over time.

**On a dataset**:
- View the composite scores in the experiments tab. You can also filter and sort experiments based on the average composite score of their runs.
- Click into an experiment to view the composite score for each run.

<Note> If any of the constituent evaluators are not configured on the run, the composite score will not be calculated for that run. </Note>

## Create composite feedback with the SDK

This guide describes setting up an evaluation that uses multiple evaluators and combines their scores with a custom aggregation function.

<Note> Requires langsmith>=0.4.29 </Note>

### 1. Configure evaluators on a dataset
Start by configuring your evaluators. In this example, the application generates a tweet from a blog introduction and uses three evaluators — summary, tone, and formatting — to assess the output.

If you already have your own dataset with evaluators configured, you can skip this step.

### 2. Create composite feedback

Create composite feedback that aggregates the individual evaluator scores using your custom function. This example uses a weighted average of the individual evaluator scores.

<Accordion title="Create a composite feedback.">

```python
from typing import Dict
import math
from langsmith import Client
from dotenv import load_dotenv

load_dotenv()

# TODO: Replace with your experiment name. Can be found in UI or from the above client.evaluate() result
YOUR_EXPERIMENT_NAME = "placeholder_experiment_name"

# Set weights for the individual evaluator scores
DEFAULT_WEIGHTS: Dict[str, float] = {
    "summary": 0.7,
    "tone": 0.2,
    "formatting": 0.1,
}
WEIGHTED_FEEDBACK_NAME = "weighted_summary"

# Pull experiment results
client = Client()
results = client.get_experiment_results(
    name=YOUR_EXPERIMENT_NAME,
)

# Calculate weighted score for each run
def calculate_weighted_score(feedback_stats: dict) -> float:
    if not feedback_stats:
        return float("nan")

    # Check if all required metrics are present and have data
    required_metrics = set(DEFAULT_WEIGHTS.keys())
    available_metrics = set(feedback_stats.keys())

    if not required_metrics.issubset(available_metrics):
        return float("nan")

    # Calculate weighted score
    total_score = 0.0
    for metric, weight in DEFAULT_WEIGHTS.items():
        metric_data = feedback_stats[metric]
        if metric_data.get("n", 0) > 0 and "avg" in metric_data:
            total_score += metric_data["avg"] * weight
        else:
            return float("nan")

    return total_score

# Process each run and write feedback
# Note that experiment results need to finish processing before this should be called.
for example_with_runs in results["examples_with_runs"]:
    for run in example_with_runs.runs:
        if run.feedback_stats:
            score = calculate_weighted_score(run.feedback_stats)
            if not math.isnan(score):
                client.create_feedback(
                    run_id=run.id,
                    key=WEIGHTED_FEEDBACK_NAME,
                    score=float(score)
                )
```
