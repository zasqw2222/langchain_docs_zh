[Studio](/langsmith/studio) in the [LangSmith Deployments UI](https://smith.langchain.com) supports connecting to two types of graphs:

- Graphs deployed on [cloud or self-hosted](#deployed-graphs).
- Graphs running locally with [Agent Server](#local-development-server).

## Deployed graphs

Studio is accessed in the [LangSmith UI](https://smith.langchain.com) from the **Deployments** navigation.

For applications that are [deployed](/langsmith/deployment-quickstart), you can access Studio as part of that deployment. To do so, navigate to the deployment in the UI and select **Studio**.

This will load Studio connected to your live deployment, allowing you to create, read, and update the [threads](/oss/python/langgraph/persistence#threads), [assistants](/langsmith/assistants), and [memory](/oss/python/concepts/memory) in that deployment.

## Local development server

### Prerequisites

To test your application locally using Studio:

- Follow the [local application quickstart](/langsmith/local-server) first.
- If you don't want data [traced](/langsmith/observability-concepts#traces) to LangSmith, set `LANGSMITH_TRACING=false` in your application's `.env` file. With tracing disabled, no data leaves your local server.

### Setup

1. Install the [LangGraph CLI](/langsmith/cli):

    <CodeGroup>
    ```bash pip
    pip install -U "langgraph-cli[inmem]"
    langgraph dev
    ```

    ```bash uv
    uv add langgraph-cli[inmem]
    langgraph dev
    ```

    ```bash npm
    npx @langchain/langgraph-cli dev
    ```
    </CodeGroup>

    <Warning>
    **Browser Compatibility**
    Safari blocks `localhost` connections to Studio. To work around this, run the command with `--tunnel` to access Studio via a secure tunnel.
    </Warning>

    This will start the Agent Server locally, running in-memory. The server will run in watch mode, listening for and automatically restarting on code changes. Read this [reference](/langsmith/cli#dev) to learn about all the options for starting the API server.

    You will see the following logs:

    ```
    > Ready!
    >
    > - API: [http://localhost:2024](http://localhost:2024/)
    >
    > - Docs: http://localhost:2024/docs
    >
    > - LangSmith Studio Web UI: https://smith.langchain.com/studio/?baseUrl=http://127.0.0.1:2024
    ```

    Once running, you will automatically be directed to Studio.

1. For a running server, access the Dbugger with one of the following:
    1. Directly navigate to the following URL: `https://smith.langchain.com/studio/?baseUrl=http://127.0.0.1:2024`.
    1. Navigate to **Deployments** in the UI, click the **Studio** button on a deployment, enter `http://127.0.0.1:2024` and click **Connect**.

    If running your server at a different host or port, update the `baseUrl` to match.

### (Optional) Attach a debugger

For step-by-step debugging with breakpoints and variable inspection, run the following:

    <CodeGroup>
    ```bash pip
    # Install debugpy package
    pip install debugpy
    # Start server with debugging enabled
    langgraph dev --debug-port 5678
    ```

    ```bash uv
    # Install debugpy package
    uv add debugpy
    # Start server with debugging enabled
    langgraph dev --debug-port 5678
    ```
    </CodeGroup>

Then attach your preferred debugger:

<Tabs>
    <Tab title="VS Code">
    Add this configuration to `launch.json`:

    ```json
    {
        "name": "Attach to LangGraph",
        "type": "debugpy",
        "request": "attach",
        "connect": {
          "host": "0.0.0.0",
          "port": 5678
        }
    }
    ```
    </Tab>
    <Tab title="PyCharm">
    1. Go to Run → Edit Configurations
    2. Click + and select "Python Debug Server"
    3. Set IDE host name: `localhost`
    4. Set port: `5678` (or the port number you chose in the previous step)
    5. Click "OK" and start debugging
    </Tab>
</Tabs>
