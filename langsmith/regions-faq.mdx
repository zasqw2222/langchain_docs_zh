## Legal and compliance

#### *What privacy and data protection frameworks does LangSmith, including its EU instance, comply with?*

LangSmith complies with the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and other laws and regulations applicable to the LangSmith service. We are also SOC 2 Type 2 certified and are HIPAA compliant. You can request more information about our security policies and posture at [trust.langchain.com](https://trust.langchain.com). If you would like to sign a Data Processing Addendum (DPA) with us, please reach out to [support@langchain.dev](mailto:support@langchain.dev). Please note we only enter into Business Associate Agreements (BAAs) with customers on our Enterprise plan.

#### *My company isn't based in the EU, can I still have my data hosted there?*

Yes, you can host your LangSmith data in the EU instance independent of your location.

#### *Do you have a legal entity in the EU that we can contract with?*

We do not have a legal entity in the EU for customer contracting today.

#### *Do different legal terms apply if I choose the EU region?*

The terms are the same for the EU and US regions.

## Features

#### *How do I use the EU instance?*

Follow the instructions [here](/langsmith/create-account-api-key) to create an account and an API key (make sure to change the region to EU in the dropdown)

#### *Are there any functional differences between US and EU cloud-managed LangSmith?*

There may be a small delay between launches to each region depending on the feature. Besides that, they are functionally equivalent - all features supported in the US are supported in the EU and vice versa.

#### *Can an organization have workspaces in different regions?*

LangSmith does not support this at the moment, but if you are interested, please contact [support@langchain.dev](mailto:support@langchain.dev) and share your use case.

#### *Can I connect an EU organization to a US organization and share billing?*

LangSmith does not support this at the moment, but if you are interested, please contact [support@langchain.dev](mailto:support@langchain.dev) and share your use case.

#### *What data will be stored in my selected region?*

See the [cloud architecture reference](/langsmith/cloud#architecture) for details.

#### *How can I see my organization's region?*

Check your URL - any organizations on [https://eu.smith.langchain.com](https://eu.smith.langchain.com) are in the EU, and any on [https://smith.langchain.com](https://smith.langchain.com) are in the US.

#### *Can I switch my organization from the US to EU or vice versa?*

We do not support migration between regions at this time, but if you are interested in this feature, please reach out to [support@langchain.dev](mailto:support@langchain.dev).
