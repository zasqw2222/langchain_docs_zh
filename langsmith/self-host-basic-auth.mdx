LangSmith supports login via username/password with a few limitations:

* You cannot change an existing installation from basic auth mode to OAuth with PKCE (deprecated) or vice versa - installations must be either one or the other. **A basic auth installation requires a completely fresh installation including a separate PostgreSQL database/schema, unless migrating from an existing `None` type installation (see below).**
* Users must be given their initial auto-generated password once they are invited. This password may be changed later by any Organization Admin.
* You cannot use both basic auth and OAuth with client secret at the same time.

## Requirements and features

* There is a single `Default` organization that is provisioned during initial installation, and creating additional organizations is not supported
* Your initial password (configured below) must be least 12 characters long and have at least one lowercase, uppercase, and symbol
* There are no strict requirements for the secret used for signing JWTs, but we recommend securely generating a string of at least 32 characters. For example: `openssl rand -base64 32`

### Migrating from None auth

**Only supported in versions 0.7 and above.**

Migrating an installation from [None](/langsmith/authentication-methods#none) auth mode replaces the single "default" user with a user with the configured credentials and keeps all existing resources. The single pre-existing workspace ID post-migration remains `00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000`, but everything else about the migrated installation is standard for a basic auth installation.

To migrate, simply update your configuration as shown below and run `helm upgrade` (or `docker-compose up`) as usual.

### Configuration

<Note>
Changing the JWT secret will log out your users
</Note>

<CodeGroup>

```yaml Helm
config:
  authType: mixed
  basicAuth:
    enabled: true
    initialOrgAdminEmail: <YOUR EMAIL ADDRESS>
    initialOrgAdminPassword: <PASSWORD> # Must be at least 12 characters long and have at least one lowercase, uppercase, and symbol
    jwtSecret: <SECRET>
```

```bash Docker
# In your .env file
AUTH_TYPE=mixed
BASIC_AUTH_ENABLED=true
INITIAL_ORG_ADMIN_EMAIL=<YOUR EMAIL ADDRESS>
INITIAL_ORG_ADMIN_PASSWORD=<PASSWORD> # Must be at least 12 characters long and have at least one lowercase, uppercase, and symbol
BASIC_AUTH_JWT_SECRET=<SECRET>
```

</CodeGroup>

Additionally, in docker-compose you will need to run the bootstrap command to create the initial organization and user:

```bash
docker-compose exec langchain-backend python hooks/auth_bootstrap.pyc
```

Once configured, you will see a login screen like the one below. You should be able to login with the `initialOrgAdminEmail` and `initialOrgAdminPassword` values, and your user will be auto-provisioned with role `Organization Admin`. See the [admin guide](/langsmith/administration-overview#organization-roles) for more details on organization roles.
