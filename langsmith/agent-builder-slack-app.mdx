## Privacy policy

The LangSmith Agent Builder Slack app collects, manages, and stores third-party data in accordance with our privacy policy. For full details on how your data is handled, please see [our privacy policy](https://www.langchain.com/privacy-policy).

## AI components and disclaimers

The LangSmith Agent Builder uses large language models (LLMs) to power AI agents that interact with users in Slack. While these models are powerful, they have the potential to generate inaccurate responses, summaries, or other outputs.

### What you should know

- **AI-generated content**: All responses from agents are generated by AI and may contain errors or inaccuracies. Always verify important information.
- **Data usage**: Slack data is not used to train LLMs. Your workspace data remains private and is only used to provide agent functionality.
- **Transparency**: The Agent Builder is transparent about the actions it will take once added to your workspace, as outlined in the permissions section above.

### Technical details

The Agent Builder uses the following approach to AI:

- **Model**: Uses LLMs provided through the LangSmith platform
- **Data retention**: User data is retained according to LangSmith's data retention policies
- **Data tenancy**: Data is handled according to your LangSmith organization settings
- **Data residency**: Data residency follows your LangSmith configuration

For more information about AI safety and best practices, see the [Agent Builder documentation](/langsmith/agent-builder).

## Pricing

The LangSmith Agent Builder Slack app itself does not have any direct pricing. However, agent runs and traces are billed through the [LangSmith platform](https://smith.langchain.com) according to your organization's plan.
