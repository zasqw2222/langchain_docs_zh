**Feedback** is LangSmith's way of storing the criteria and scores from evaluation on a particular trace or intermediate run (span). Feedback can be produced from a variety of ways, such as:

1. [Sent up along with a trace](/langsmith/attach-user-feedback) from the LLM application
2. Generated by a user in the app [inline](/langsmith/annotate-traces-inline) or in an [annotation queue](/langsmith/annotation-queues)
3. Generated by an automatic evaluator during [offline evaluation](/langsmith/evaluate-llm-application)
4. Generated by an [online evaluator](/langsmith/online-evaluations)

Feedback is stored in a simple format with the following fields:

<FeedbackDataFields/>

Here is an example JSON representation of a feedback record in the above format:

```json
{
  "created_at": "2024-05-05T23:23:11.077838",
